## üîß Implementation Details

### WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration (RED Phase)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/bootstrap/stage3/multi_target_compiler.ruchy`: Core interface definition
- `/validation/wasm/test_multi_target_red.ruchy`: Comprehensive test cases
- `/validation/wasm/test_multi_target_red_runner.ruchy`: Test runner
- `/docs/research/WASM_003_RED_PHASE_COMPLETE.md`: Detailed documentation
- `/WASM_003_RED_PHASE_COMPLETE.md`: Completion report
- `/INTEGRATION.md`: Updated integration status

**Key Interface Components**:

1. **MultiTargetCompiler**:
   - Central interface for multi-target compilation
   - Unified pipeline for parsing, type checking, and code generation
   - Support for compiling to one or all available targets

2. **TargetEmitter**:
   - Interface for target-specific code generators
   - Methods for initialization, compilation, and target identification
   - Support for target-specific options

3. **CompilationOptions**:
   - Configurable optimization levels, debug info, and source maps
   - Target-specific options for WebAssembly, TypeScript, and Rust
   - Preset configurations for development and production

4. **CompiledOutput**:
   - Structured output container for generated code
   - Support for additional files (e.g., header files, type definitions)
   - Compilation metadata and warnings

## üß™ Testing Results

**WASM-003 RED Phase Tests**:
- ‚úÖ **Basic Compilation**: Fails as expected (parser and emitters not implemented)
- ‚úÖ **Target Options**: Configuration succeeds but compilation fails as expected
- ‚úÖ **Closure Compilation**: Fails as expected across all targets
- ‚úÖ **Type System**: Fails as expected for struct/enum compilation
- ‚úÖ **Target-Specific Features**: Fails as expected for target annotations
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Fails as expected for Result handling

All tests are intentionally failing as expected in the RED phase, validating that the interface is well-defined but the implementation is not yet complete.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **WASM-003 GREEN Phase**:
   - Implement the parser integration
   - Implement the type checker integration
   - Connect existing emitters (WebAssembly, TypeScript, Rust)
   - Make all RED phase tests pass

2. **WASM-003 REFACTOR Phase**:
   - Optimize the compilation process
   - Enhance error handling and reporting
   - Improve code organization and maintainability

3. **WASM-003 TOOL Phase**:
   - Validate with property testing
   - Measure performance across targets
   - Ensure code quality meets standards

## üìà Project Status Update

The WebAssembly compilation target is progressing well:
- WASM-001 is 100% complete (all phases)
- WASM-002 is 100% complete (all phases)
- WASM-003 is 25% complete (RED phase)

This puts the overall WASM compilation target at approximately 75% completion based on the current roadmap.

## üèÜ Key Achievements

1. **Unified Interface Design**:
   - Clear separation of concerns between compiler and emitters
   - Well-defined interfaces for multi-target compilation
   - Support for target-specific features and options

2. **Comprehensive Test Cases**:
   - Tests for basic compilation across all targets
   - Tests for advanced features like closures and custom types
   - Tests for target-specific annotations and imports

3. **Integration Planning**:
   - Clear path for connecting with existing emitters
   - Framework for handling different target-specific requirements
   - Roadmap for full multi-target support

The RED phase has established a solid foundation for implementing the multi-target compiler, with clear interfaces and comprehensive test cases that define the expected behavior.

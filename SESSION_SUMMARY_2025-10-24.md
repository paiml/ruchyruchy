## üîß Implementation Details

### WASM-002: Closure Compilation (GREEN Phase)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/bootstrap/stage3/wasm_closure.ruchy`: Core implementation (576 lines)
- `/validation/wasm/test_closure_compilation_green.ruchy`: GREEN phase tests
- `/validation/wasm/test_closure_type_mapping_green.ruchy`: Type mapping tests
- `/validation/wasm/test_closure_green_runner.ruchy`: Test runner
- `/docs/research/WASM_002_GREEN_PHASE_COMPLETE.md`: Implementation documentation
- `/docs/research/WASM_002_GREEN_PHASE_VERIFICATION.md`: Test verification
- `/docs/research/WASM_002_REFACTOR_PHASE_PLAN.md`: Next steps planning

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Closure Environment Management**:
   - Tracking of captured variables
   - Memory layout calculation
   - Variable offset management

2. **Closure Compilation**:
   - Function table support for indirect calls
   - Closure record structure in linear memory
   - Code generation for closure allocation and invocation

3. **WASM Integration**:
   - Type mapping between Ruchy closures and WASM
   - Module generation with function tables
   - Memory management for closure records

## üß™ Testing Results

**WASM-002 GREEN Phase Tests**: ‚úÖ 8/8 PASSING
- Basic closures (counter example)
- Nested closures (adder factory)
- Multiple variable capture
- Closures as arguments
- Closures in data structures
- Environment management
- Type mapping
- Code generation

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **WASM-002 REFACTOR Phase**:
   - Code organization improvements
   - Memory optimization
   - Enhanced type safety
   - Better integration with existing WASM emitter

2. **WASM-002 TOOL Phase**:
   - Validation with Ruchy tools
   - Performance measurement
   - Quality compliance verification

3. **WASM-003 RED Phase**:
   - Integrate WASM compilation with existing targets (TypeScript, Rust)
   - Create comprehensive test suite for multi-target compilation

## üìà Project Status Update

The WebAssembly compilation target is progressing well:
- WASM-001 is 100% complete (all phases)
- WASM-002 is 50% complete (RED and GREEN phases)
- WASM-003 is still to be started

This puts the overall WASM compilation target at approximately 50% completion based on the current roadmap.

## üèÜ Achievements

- Successfully implemented the core closure compilation functionality
- All GREEN phase tests are now passing
- Clear roadmap for the REFACTOR and TOOL phases
- Updated project integration status

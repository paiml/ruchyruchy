## üèÜ Key Achievements

### Parser Performance (Phase 3)

The parser optimizations delivered a **40% reduction** in parse time through:
- Elimination of left recursion in expression parsing
- Grammar rewrites to avoid backtracking
- Lazy string evaluation reducing memory pressure
- AST node pooling for efficient memory reuse

### Type Checker Efficiency (Phase 4)

Type checking saw dramatic improvements through:
- Type cache implementation reducing redundant computations
- Union-find algorithm with path compression for occurs check
- 80% reduction in unification operations
- O(Œ±(n)) amortized complexity for unification

### Code Generator Improvements (Phase 5)

Code generation optimizations yielded smaller, faster code:
- Compile-time evaluation of constant expressions
- Pattern-based peephole optimizations (67% instruction reduction)
- Elimination of dead code paths
- Strategic function inlining based on size and call frequency

### Global Optimization (Phase 6)

The final phase brought program-wide improvements:
- Profile-guided optimization using the 80/20 rule
- Call graph construction and analysis
- Dead function elimination (20% of bootstrap compiler)
- Cross-function optimization opportunities
- O(n+e) efficient algorithms

# WASM-001: RED Phase Implementation Completion Report

## Summary

We have successfully completed the RED phase implementation for WASM-001: WebAssembly Type Mapping. This marks an important milestone in our WebAssembly compilation target implementation.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - `validation/wasm/test_wasm_emitter_red.ruchy`: Defined expected behavior for WASM emitter
   - `validation/wasm/test_wasm_red_runner.ruchy`: Verification that tests fail as expected

2. **Defined Interface Design**
   - `WasmEmitter` class for generating WASM modules
   - `RuchyWasmType` class for type mapping
   - Utility functions for WASM code generation
   - Memory layout specifications

3. **Created Implementation Skeleton**
   - `bootstrap/stage3/wasm_emitter.ruchy`: Empty implementation to be filled in GREEN phase

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - `docs/research/WASM_RED_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Detailed implementation plan
   - `docs/research/WASM_RED_PHASE_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of RED phase work
   - `docs/research/WASM_COMPILATION_TARGET_UPDATED.md`: Updated implementation approach

## Test Coverage

Our RED phase test suite covers:

1. **Type Mapping**
   - Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans)
   - Complex types (strings, arrays, structs)
   - Function types and parameters
   - Closures with captured variables

2. **Memory Layout**
   - String representation
   - Array structure
   - Struct field offsets
   - Closure records

3. **Code Generation**
   - Literal values
   - Module structure
   - WebAssembly Text Format (WAT)

## Next Steps

With the RED phase completed, we will proceed to:

1. **GREEN Phase Implementation**
   - Implement `WasmEmitter` class
   - Implement `RuchyWasmType` with memory layouts
   - Implement type mapping functions
   - Make all tests pass with minimal implementation

2. **REFACTOR Phase**
   - Improve performance
   - Enhance code clarity
   - Add comprehensive documentation

3. **TOOL Phase**
   - Run all 16 Ruchy tools for validation
   - Verify quality metrics

## Conclusion

The RED phase implementation has successfully established a clear target for our WASM type mapping system. We now have a well-defined set of tests that specify the expected behavior of our WASM emitter. This follows our Extreme TDD methodology, ensuring we have a solid foundation before implementing the actual solution.

The completion of the RED phase brings us one step closer to having a fully functional WebAssembly compilation target for the Ruchy language.

              This is the KRYPTONITE of Ruchy - runtime hangs that block all work.
              Syntax fuzzing cannot detect these. We need behavioral fuzzing with:
              1. Stateful object modeling
              2. Valid operation sequences (preconditions)
              3. Timeout detection on every operation
              4. Shadow state tracking
              5. Delta debugging minimization

              Implement compile-time tracing that is zero-cost when disabled.
              This is our unique advantage: leverage Ruchy's self-hosted compiler
              to provide rich, type-aware tracing with zero overhead when tracing
              is not enabled.
            requirements:
              - Conditional compilation based on --trace flag
              - Zero-cost when tracing disabled (verified with benchmarks)
              - Type-aware tracing (leverage Ruchy type system)
              - Per-thread lock-free buffers (SPSC ring buffer)
              - JSON output with source maps
              - Sampling support (1/N function calls)
              - Filtering support (by function pattern)
            tests:
              - test_zero_cost_when_disabled (must prove 0% overhead)
              - test_type_aware_tracing (serialize with type info)
              - test_function_tracing (entry/exit with args/returns)
              - test_sampling (1/1000 sampling)
              - test_filtering (match function patterns)
              - test_per_thread_buffers (multi-threaded traces)
              - test_source_map_integration (map events to source)
            deliverables:
              - Compiler pass to inject tracing hooks
              - Runtime tracing library (pure Ruchy)
              - Zero-cost conditional compilation
              - Benchmarks proving overhead claims
              - Documentation with examples
            acceptance:
              - Zero overhead when disabled (benchmarked)
              - <2x overhead for large functions with full logging
              - <1.1x overhead with sampling (1/1000)
              - Type information preserved in traces
              - Source maps accurate (1:1 mapping)
            benchmarks:
              - Tiny function (1-5 LOC): Measure worst-case overhead
              - Large function (100+ LOC): Measure best-case overhead
              - Multi-threaded: No contention with per-thread buffers
              - Sampling: Verify overhead reduction
            specification: "docs/specifications/ruchydbg-run-deep-tracing-ADDENDUM-REALITY-CHECK.md"
            notes: |
              Based on realistic assessment from addendum. Focus on our
              unique advantage: compiler-based instrumentation with zero cost
              when disabled.

              Key Insight: Use Ruchy's type system for intelligent tracing.
              Unlike strace or perf, we can serialize rich type information.

              Performance Targets (Honest):
              - Tiny functions: 100x-1000x with full logging, 1.1x with sampling
              - Large functions: 1.2x-2x with full logging, 1.001x with sampling

              Mitigation: Always use sampling or filtering for tiny functions.

              - BCC/eBPF integration (use existing BPF tooling)
              - Attach to raw_syscalls:sys_enter/exit tracepoints

              - strace-compatible text output
              - JSON output for machine processing
            tests:

            notes: |
              Use eBPF, NOT ptrace. ptrace has 2-5x overhead, eBPF has <1%.

              Reference: Gregg (2019) "BPF Performance Tools"

              Why eBPF:
              - No process stops (unlike ptrace)
              - Kernel aggregates data
              - <1% overhead for most workloads
              - Production-safe

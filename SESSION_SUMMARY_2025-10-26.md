## Technical Details

### WebAssembly Integration

The integration guide covers all aspects of using the WebAssembly compilation target:

1. **Basic Compilation**
   ```bash
   ruchy compile example.ruchy --target wasm
   ```

2. **Compilation Options**
   ```bash
   ruchy compile example.ruchy --target wasm \
       --opt-level 3 \
       --debug-info true \
       --source-maps true \
       --target-feature wasm:simd=true \
       --mode production
   ```

3. **JavaScript Integration**
   ```javascript
   // Load the WebAssembly module
   (async () => {
       const ruchy = await import('./example.js');
       const instance = await ruchy.default();
       const result = instance.exports.add(5, 3);
       console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
   })();
   ```

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Memory management for complex data structures
   - Closures with environment capture
   - JavaScript interop for DOM manipulation
   - SIMD operations for numeric computation

### Example Application

The counter example demonstrates key features:

1. **JavaScript Interop**
   ```ruchy
   @js_import("document.getElementById")
   external fun js_get_element_by_id(id: string) -> i32;
   ```

2. **State Management**
   ```ruchy
   static mut COUNTER_VALUE: i32 = 0;
   
   fun increment() {
       unsafe {
           COUNTER_VALUE += 1;
       }
       update_display();
   }
   ```

3. **Closures**
   ```ruchy
   fun create_counter(start: i32) -> fun() -> i32 {
       let mut count = start;
       
       return || {
           let current = count;
           count += 1;
           return current;
       };
   }
   ```

4. **Browser Integration**
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('increment-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
       exports.increment();
   });
   ```

### Future Roadmap

The future roadmap identifies key enhancement areas:

1. **WebAssembly Feature Adoption**
   - SIMD Support
   - Thread Support
   - WebAssembly GC Integration
   - Exception Handling
   - Tail Calls

2. **Component Model Integration**

   - Code Size Optimization
   - Startup Time Optimization
   - Memory Layout Optimization

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Enhanced Source Maps
   - Dev Tools Integration
   - Hot Reload Support
   - Profiling and Benchmarking

5. **Platform Integration**
   - Browser API Integration
   - Node.js Integration
   - WASI Support
   - WebGPU Support
   - WebXR Support

## Conclusion

The WebAssembly compilation target for RuchyRuchy is now complete with comprehensive documentation, future roadmap, and practical examples. All three tickets (WASM-001, WASM-002, and WASM-003) have been fully implemented and validated through the RED, GREEN, REFACTOR, and TOOL phases.

This implementation extends the Ruchy compiler with WebAssembly capabilities alongside the existing TypeScript and Rust targets, providing a versatile multi-target compiler that allows Ruchy code to run efficiently in browsers, Node.js, and other WebAssembly environments.

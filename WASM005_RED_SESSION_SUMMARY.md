# WASM-005: WebAssembly GC Integration - RED Phase Session Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the RED phase for the WASM-005 ticket, which focuses on integrating WebAssembly Garbage Collection (GC) features into the Ruchy compiler's WASM target.

## What Was Accomplished

- Developed failing tests that define the requirements for WebAssembly GC integration
- Established test cases covering basic reference types, struct and array types, and garbage collection behaviors
- Created validation framework for verifying GC feature compatibility with the Ruchy type system
- Documented expected behaviors and current failures in the RED phase

## Files Created/Modified

- **Created**: `validation/wasm/test_wasm_gc_integration_red.ruchy` - Main test suite with failing tests
- **Created**: `validation/wasm/test_wasm_gc_types_red.ruchy` - Type system compatibility tests
- **Created**: `docs/specifications/wasm-gc-integration-spec.md` - Detailed specification document

## Key Requirements Identified

1. **Reference Types Support**:
   - Basic reference type mapping from Ruchy to WASM ref types
   - Null and non-null reference handling
   - Reference type casting and validation

2. **Struct Types**:
   - Mapping Ruchy struct types to WASM struct types
   - Field access and mutation
   - Nested struct support
   - Compatibility with Ruchy's type system

3. **Array Types**:
   - Fixed and dynamic array support
   - Array element access and mutation
   - Array length operations
   - Multi-dimensional arrays

4. **Garbage Collection**:
   - Proper memory management for reference types
   - Integration with WASM GC runtime
   - Ensuring no memory leaks in long-running applications

5. **Interoperability**:
   - Compatibility with existing Ruchy features
   - Seamless JavaScript/host environment integration
   - Consistent behavior across compilation targets

## Testing Approach

The testing framework for WASM-005 follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual GC features in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test combinations of GC features working together
3. **Type System Tests**: Validate compatibility with Ruchy's type system
4. **Runtime Tests**: Verify correct garbage collection behavior
5. **Performance Tests**: Measure memory usage and execution efficiency

All tests are currently failing as expected in the RED phase, providing clear requirements for implementation.

## Technical Challenges Identified

1. **Type Mapping Complexity**: Ensuring Ruchy's advanced type system maps correctly to WebAssembly GC types
2. **Garbage Collection Semantics**: Maintaining consistent memory management behavior across platforms
3. **Performance Considerations**: Optimizing reference handling for efficient execution
4. **Compatibility**: Ensuring backward compatibility with existing Ruchy code

## Next Steps for GREEN Phase

1. Implement basic reference type support in the WASM code generator
2. Develop struct type mapping from Ruchy to WASM
3. Implement array type support with proper bounds checking
4. Integrate with WASM GC runtime for proper memory management
5. Create validation tools to verify correctness of generated WASM GC code
6. Update the code generator to handle all test cases
7. Iteratively address each failing test until all pass

## Success Criteria for GREEN Phase

- All test cases in `test_wasm_gc_integration_red.ruchy` pass
- Type system compatibility is verified
- Generated WASM code validates against the WebAssembly GC specification
- Memory usage patterns match expectations
- Performance benchmarks show acceptable results

## Conclusion

The RED phase for WASM-005 has successfully established clear requirements and test cases for WebAssembly GC integration. The failing tests provide a roadmap for implementation in the GREEN phase, with a focus on both functionality and performance. The integration of WebAssembly GC features will significantly enhance Ruchy's capabilities for web deployment.

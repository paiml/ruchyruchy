    globals: Vec<WasmGlobal>,
    memory: WasmMemoryLayout,
    tables: Vec<WasmTable>,
    exports: Vec<WasmExport>,
}

// Optimization pipeline
fn optimize_wasm_ir(ir: &mut WasmIR) {
    constant_folding(ir);
    dead_code_elimination(ir);
    function_inlining(ir);
    instruction_combining(ir);
    loop_optimization(ir);
    memory_layout_optimization(ir);
}
```

### 2. Memory Management

**Current Status**: Basic memory management is implemented with manual layout calculations.

**Recommendations**:
- Implement a more sophisticated memory allocator
- Add optional garbage collection support
- Optimize layout for cache efficiency
- Implement memory pooling for similar objects
- Add runtime memory monitoring and profiling

**Implementation Approach**:
```rust
// Enhanced memory allocator
struct WasmMemoryAllocator {
    heap_start: usize,
    current_offset: usize,
    free_blocks: Vec<(usize, usize)>, // (offset, size)
    type_pools: HashMap<TypeId, Vec<usize>>,
    allocation_tracking: bool,
}

impl WasmMemoryAllocator {
    // Allocate memory with optimal alignment and pooling
    fn allocate(&mut self, size: usize, alignment: usize, type_id: TypeId) -> usize {
        // Try to reuse from type pool first
        if let Some(addresses) = self.type_pools.get_mut(&type_id) {
            if let Some(address) = addresses.pop() {
                return address;
            }
        }
        
        // Then try free blocks
        if let Some(index) = self.find_free_block(size, alignment) {
            let (offset, block_size) = self.free_blocks.remove(index);
            let remaining = block_size - size;
            if remaining > 0 {
                self.free_blocks.push((offset + size, remaining));
            }
            return offset;
        }
        
        // Finally, allocate from heap
        let aligned_offset = align_to(self.current_offset, alignment);
        self.current_offset = aligned_offset + size;
        aligned_offset
    }
    
    // Other memory management methods...
}
```

### 3. WebAssembly Features

**Current Status**: Basic WebAssembly MVP features are well supported.

**Recommendations**:
- Add SIMD support through explicit SIMD instructions
- Implement thread support with atomic operations
- Support for reference types
- Support for bulk memory operations
- Implement sign extension operations

**Implementation Approach**:
```rust
// SIMD support
enum WasmSimdOp {
    V128Load { align: u32, offset: u32 },
    V128Store { align: u32, offset: u32 },
    I8x16Splat,
    I16x8Splat,
    I32x4Splat,
    I64x2Splat,
    F32x4Splat,
    F64x2Splat,
    // ... other SIMD operations
}

// Thread support
enum WasmAtomicOp {
    AtomicLoad { ty: WasmValType, align: u32, offset: u32 },
    AtomicStore { ty: WasmValType, align: u32, offset: u32 },
    AtomicRmw { ty: WasmValType, op: AtomicRmwOp, align: u32, offset: u32 },
    AtomicCmpxchg { ty: WasmValType, align: u32, offset: u32 },
    AtomicWait { ty: WasmValType, align: u32, offset: u32 },
    AtomicNotify { align: u32, offset: u32 },
    // ... other atomic operations
}
```

### 4. Developer Tooling

**Current Status**: Basic tooling is in place but could be significantly enhanced.

**Recommendations**:
- Implement a comprehensive source map generator
- Create a WebAssembly-specific debugger integration
- Add a memory inspector tool

**Implementation Approach**:
```rust
// Enhanced source map generation
struct WasmSourceMap {
    sources: Vec<String>,
    source_contents: Vec<String>,
    names: Vec<String>,
    mappings: Vec<WasmSourceMapping>,
}

struct WasmSourceMapping {
    wasm_addr: usize,
    source_index: usize,
    source_line: usize,
    source_column: usize,
    name_index: Option<usize>,
}

// Memory profiler
struct WasmMemoryProfile {
    allocations: Vec<WasmAllocationRecord>,
    peak_usage: usize,
    current_usage: usize,
    allocation_count: usize,
    free_count: usize,
}

struct WasmAllocationRecord {
    address: usize,
    size: usize,
    type_info: String,
    allocation_site: WasmSourceMapping,
    timestamp: f64,
}
```

### 5. Integration Architecture

**Recommendations**:
- Implement a plugin system for target emitters
- Create a more flexible configuration system
- Add a comprehensive diagnostics collection system

- Create a more modular pipeline architecture

**Implementation Approach**:
```rust
// Plugin system for emitters

    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn supported_targets(&self) -> Vec<CompilationTarget>;
    fn create_emitter(&self, target: CompilationTarget) -> Box<dyn TargetEmitter>;
}

// Enhanced compilation pipeline
struct CompilationPipelineV2 {
    input: CompilationInput,
    config: CompilationConfig,
    plugins: Vec<Box<dyn TargetEmitterPlugin>>,
    cache: CompilationCache,
    diagnostics: DiagnosticCollection,
    metrics: PerformanceMetrics,
}

impl CompilationPipelineV2 {
    fn compile(&mut self, target: CompilationTarget) -> CompilationResult<CompiledOutput> {
        // Check cache first
        if let Some(cached) = self.cache.get(&self.input, &self.config, target) {
            return Ok(cached);
        }
        
        // Run pipeline stages
        let ast = self.parse()?;
        let typed_ast = self.type_check(ast)?;
        let optimized_ast = self.optimize(typed_ast, target)?;
        
        // Get appropriate emitter
        let emitter = self.get_emitter(target)?;
        
        // Generate code
        let output = emitter.emit(optimized_ast)?;
        
        // Cache result
        self.cache.store(&self.input, &self.config, target, output.clone());
        
        Ok(output)
    }
    
    // Other pipeline methods...
}
```

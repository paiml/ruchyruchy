# DEBUGGER-009: Deterministic Replay - 100% EXTREME TDD COMPLETE

**Feature**: Deterministic Replay of Execution Sequences
**Phase**: Time-Travel Debugging (Phase 3 of Debugger Roadmap)
**Status**: ✅ **100% EXTREME TDD ACHIEVED** (9th consecutive!)
**Date**: October 22, 2025

## All 8 EXTREME TDD Phases Complete

### ✅ Phase 1: RED - 4/10 passing (demonstrates need)
### ✅ Phase 2: GREEN - 384 LOC, 10/10 passing
### ✅ Phase 3: REFACTOR - GREEN baseline (clean structure)
### ✅ Phase 4: TOOL - A+ grade (0 errors, 30 warnings)
### ✅ Phase 5: MUTATION - 100% score (6/6 mutations killed)
### ✅ Phase 6: PROPERTY - 750 iterations (100% pass)
### ✅ Phase 7: FUZZ - 120K iterations (0 crashes)
### ✅ Phase 8: PORTFOLIO - 100 runs (variance 0, 100% determinism)

**Total: 120,860+ test executions**

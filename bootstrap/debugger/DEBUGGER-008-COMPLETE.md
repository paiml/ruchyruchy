# DEBUGGER-008: Time-Travel Navigation - 100% EXTREME TDD COMPLETE

**Feature**: Time-Travel Navigation through Execution History
**Phase**: Time-Travel Debugging (Phase 3 of Debugger Roadmap)
**Status**: ‚úÖ **100% EXTREME TDD ACHIEVED** (8th consecutive!)
**Date**: October 22, 2025

---

## All 8 EXTREME TDD Phases Complete

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: RED - 5/10 passing (demonstrates need)
### ‚úÖ Phase 2: GREEN - 396 LOC, 10/10 passing
### ‚úÖ Phase 3: REFACTOR - GREEN baseline (clean structure)
### ‚úÖ Phase 4: TOOL - A+ grade (0 errors, 33 warnings)
### ‚úÖ Phase 5: MUTATION - 100% score (6/6 mutations killed)
### ‚úÖ Phase 6: PROPERTY - 750 iterations (100% pass)
### ‚úÖ Phase 7: FUZZ - 120K iterations (0 crashes)
### ‚úÖ Phase 8: PORTFOLIO - 100 runs (variance 0, 100% determinism)

**Total: 120,860+ test executions**

## Features Implemented

- Navigation state initialization from execution buffer
- Step forward through execution history
- Step backward through execution history
- Direct position jumping (goto position N)
- Boundary checking (can go forward/backward)
- Get current event at navigation position
- Jump to start of execution
- Jump to end of execution

**Design**: Simple position tracking with immutable state, bounds checking, zero crashes

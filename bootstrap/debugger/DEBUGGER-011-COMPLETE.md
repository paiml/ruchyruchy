## All 8 EXTREME TDD Phases Complete

### ✅ Phase 1: RED - 3/10 passing (demonstrates need)
### ✅ Phase 2: GREEN - 305 LOC, 10/10 passing
### ✅ Phase 3: REFACTOR - GREEN baseline (clean structure)
### ✅ Phase 4: TOOL - A+ grade (0 errors, 29 warnings)
### ✅ Phase 5: MUTATION - 100% score (6/6 mutations killed)
### ✅ Phase 6: PROPERTY - 750 iterations (100% pass)
### ✅ Phase 7: FUZZ - 120K iterations (0 crashes)
### ✅ Phase 8: PORTFOLIO - 100 runs (variance 0, 100% determinism)

**Total: 120,860+ test executions**

## Features Implemented

- Variable representation (name, value, type, scope level)
- Scope creation with variable storage (3 variables max)
- Add/get/check variables in scope
- Scope stack with push/pop operations (3 scopes max)
- Current scope retrieval
- Variable lookup with scope chain traversal
- Nested scope support

**Design**: Fixed-size structures (3 variables per scope, 3 scopes per stack), immutable operations, zero crashes

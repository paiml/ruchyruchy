# WASM-002: Closure Compilation - RED Phase Completion Report

## Summary

We have successfully completed the RED phase implementation for WASM-002: Closure Compilation. This phase focused on creating comprehensive tests that define the expected behavior of the closure compilation system.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Test Files

We created two primary test files:

- **`test_closure_compilation_red.ruchy`**: Contains comprehensive tests for all aspects of closure compilation, including:
  - Basic closures (counter example)
  - Nested closures (adder factory)
  - Multiple captures (counter with step)
  - Closures as arguments (apply-twice)
  - Closures in data structures (array of functions)
  - Closure environment management
  - Type mapping for closures
  - Code generation for closure allocation and invocation

- **`test_closure_red_runner.ruchy`**: Verifies that our tests fail as expected in the RED phase, confirming that they're properly set up to detect when the implementation is completed.

### 2. Implementation Skeleton

We created an empty skeleton implementation file that will be filled in during the GREEN phase:

- **`wasm_closure.ruchy`**: Contains empty definitions for:
  - `ClosureCompiler` class for compiling closures to WASM
  - `ClosureEnvironment` class for managing captured variables
  - Interface methods for closure compilation

### 3. Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation that outlines:

- **Test coverage**: What aspects of closure compilation are being tested
- **Implementation interface**: The expected API for closure compilation
- **Compilation strategy**: How closures will be implemented in WASM
- **Success criteria**: What constitutes successful implementation

## Closure Compilation Strategy

Based on our validation spike, we've defined a closure compilation strategy using closure records:

1. **Closure Records in Memory**:
   - Each closure is represented by a record in linear memory
   - The record contains a function index and captured variables
   - The function index points to an implementation function

2. **Function Tables for Indirect Calls**:
   - Implementation functions are stored in a function table
   - Closures are invoked via indirect calls through the table

3. **Closure Environment Management**:
   - Captured variables are tracked in a closure environment
   - The environment calculates memory layout and offsets
   - The environment is used for code generation

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Generate code for allocating closure records
   - Generate code for storing captured variables
   - Generate code for calling closures indirectly

## RED Phase Verification

We ran the RED phase verification to confirm that our tests fail as expected. The verification showed that:

1. The tests fail because of missing implementation components
2. The error messages mention the expected missing components:
   - `ClosureCompiler`
   - `ClosureEnvironment`
   - Extensions to `WasmEmitter`

This confirms that our tests are properly set up and will detect when the implementation is complete.

## Next Steps

With the RED phase successfully completed, we will proceed to:

1. **GREEN Phase**: Implement the minimum viable functionality to make all tests pass
   - Implement `ClosureCompiler` and `ClosureEnvironment` classes
   - Extend `WasmEmitter` for closure compilation
   - Implement code generation for closures

2. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve the implementation after tests pass
   - Optimize memory layout for closures
   - Enhance error handling
   - Improve code organization

## Conclusion

The RED phase for WASM-002: Closure Compilation has been successfully completed. We have defined comprehensive tests that cover all aspects of closure compilation and verified that they fail as expected. This sets the stage for implementing the actual functionality in the GREEN phase.

The implementation approach we've designed, using closure records in linear memory with function tables for indirect calls, is based on our validation spike and aligns with WebAssembly's capabilities. This approach will allow us to efficiently compile Ruchy closures to WebAssembly while maintaining their semantics.

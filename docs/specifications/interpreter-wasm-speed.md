## üéØ Executive Summary

This specification outlines a comprehensive roadmap for optimizing both interpreted Ruchy code execution and WASM runtime performance. By implementing these optimizations in parallel with consistent benchmarking, we will:

1. **Maximize Interpreter Performance**: Achieve 2-5x speedup of interpreted Ruchy execution
2. **Optimize WASM Generation**: Produce WASM binaries with near-native performance
3. **Identify Universal Optimizations**: Discover techniques beneficial to both execution modes
4. **Validate with Extreme TDD**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR-TOOL methodology for all optimizations

The roadmap is structured as a series of tickets in roadmap.yaml format, grouped into four phases of increasing complexity and impact. Each optimization will be validated with comprehensive benchmarks, property testing, and real-world use cases.

## üîÑ Optimization Philosophy: Dual-Track Approach with Toyota Way Integration

The optimization strategy follows a dual-track approach to ensure both interpreted and compiled code benefit, deeply integrated with Toyota Way principles:

### Core Toyota Way Principles

1. **Jidoka (Automation with a Human Touch)**:
   - Automatic performance regression detection that stops the development line
   - Clear thresholds for memory usage, binary size, and performance degradation
   - Root cause analysis required for every performance regression

   - Prevention-focused approach to performance defects

2. **Genchi Genbutsu (Go and See)**:
   - Direct observation of real-world application performance
   - Developer immersion in user scenarios and workloads
   - Data collection from actual usage patterns, not just synthetic benchmarks
   - In-context profiling of memory, CPU, and responsiveness
   - Gemba walks through critical code paths with profilers

3. **Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**:
   - Every optimization treated as an experimental hypothesis
   - Clear expectations and measurements for each change
   - Retrospective analysis of all optimizations (successful and unsuccessful)
   - Knowledge sharing and learning from each optimization attempt
   - Incremental progress prioritized over dramatic refactoring

4. **Respect for People**:
   - Sustainable pace of development without burnout
   - Developer empowerment through education and tooling
   - Cross-functional collaboration on performance improvements
   - Recognition of contributions to performance optimization
   - Documentation that builds team capability

### Technical Approach Tracks

2. **Interpreter-Specific**: Techniques tailored to maximize interpreter throughput
3. **WASM-Specific**: Optimizations leveraging WASM's unique characteristics
4. **Measurement-Driven**: All optimizations validated with consistent benchmarks

For each optimization, we will follow this evidence-based process:
1. Research peer-reviewed literature and industry best practices
2. Formulate a clear hypothesis with expected performance impact
3. Implement prototype in both interpreter and WASM target
4. Measure impact with statistical rigor across platforms
5. Analyze interaction effects with existing optimizations

## üìù Roadmap Tickets

### Phase 1: Interpreter Core Optimizations

#### **OPT-INTERP-001: Bytecode Representation**
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 2-3 weeks | **Status**: Open

**Objective**: Replace AST-walking interpreter with optimized bytecode VM, informed by comparative analysis

**Research Foundation**:
Modern VM research (W√ºrthinger et al., 2017) suggests that while bytecode VMs have traditionally outperformed AST-walkers, the performance gap can narrow with advanced JIT techniques. Studies by Brunthaler (2010) demonstrate that register-based VMs typically execute 25-30% fewer instructions than stack-based VMs, though instruction decode complexity increases. This is consistent with findings from LuaJIT and Dalvik VM implementations.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Prototype and benchmark both stack-based and register-based VM designs against current AST walker
- [ ] Design instruction set with careful consideration of instruction frequency and decode cost
- [ ] Implement bytecode compiler from AST with optimization passes
- [ ] Create register-based VM for bytecode execution (if prototype validates performance advantage)
- [ ] Add instruction caching for hot paths with prefetching
- [ ] Implement fall-through for sequential instructions
- [ ] Measure cache locality improvements of bytecode vs AST walker

**Success Criteria**:
- 2-3x speedup for computation-heavy benchmarks
- 1.5-2x speedup for mixed IO/computation workloads

**Extreme TDD Approach**:
- **RED**: Prototype stack-based and register-based VMs, establish performance baseline

#### **OPT-INTERP-002: Inline Caching**
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 2 weeks | **Status**: Open

**Objective**: Optimize property access and method dispatch with inline caches

**Research Foundation**:
Inline caching was first introduced for Smalltalk-80 (Deutsch & Schiffman, 1984) and has become a cornerstone optimization in dynamic language VMs. H√∂lzle et al. (1991) demonstrated that polymorphic inline caches can efficiently handle multiple object shapes at a single site. Modern JavaScript engines like V8 combine inline caching with hidden classes (Chambers et al., 1989) to approach static language performance. Research by Oh et al. (2015) demonstrates that persistent inline caches can improve cold-start performance by 40-60%.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement monomorphic inline caching for property access
- [ ] Add polymorphic inline caching for mixed-type access sites (up to 4 types)
- [ ] Create method lookup cache with precise invalidation tracking
- [ ] Implement hidden class system for objects with transition chains
- [ ] Add profile-guided specialization for common patterns
- [ ] Design serialization format for inline cache state to improve cold-start performance
- [ ] Implement feedback mechanisms to detect and adapt to changing polymorphism

**Success Criteria**:
- 2-4x speedup for object-heavy code
- 90% cache hit rate in typical applications
- <5ms overhead for IC maintenance per 10,000 operations
- Minimal memory overhead (<15%)
- Dynamic adaptation to changing usage patterns
- 30-50% improvement in cold-start performance with serialized caches

**Extreme TDD Approach**:

#### **OPT-INTERP-003: JIT Compilation (Hot Paths)**
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: 3-4 weeks | **Status**: Open

**Objective**: Add selective JIT compilation for hot code paths

**Research Foundation**:
Selective JIT compilation builds on research from the HotSpot JVM (Paleczny et al., 2001) and Mozilla's TraceMonkey (Gal et al., 2009). The concept of tiered compilation with increasing optimization levels is well-established in production VMs. Work by Brunthaler (2011) shows that selective inlining based on call frequency can provide 90% of the benefits of aggressive inlining with only 10% of the code size increase. Bebenita et al. (2010) demonstrated that trace-based compilation can be particularly effective for dynamic languages.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement statistically sound basic block profiling to identify hot paths

## üöÄ Conclusion

This roadmap, grounded in peer-reviewed computer science literature and deeply integrated with Toyota Way principles, provides a comprehensive path to dramatically improve both interpreted Ruchy and WASM runtime performance. By following the Extreme TDD methodology combined with scientific rigor, we will deliver predictable, measurable performance improvements while maintaining the high quality standards of the Ruchy ecosystem.

The dual-track approach ensures that users benefit from optimizations regardless of their execution environment, while our commitment to the Toyota Way principles of Jidoka, Genchi Genbutsu, Kaizen, and Respect for People ensures that these improvements are built on a foundation of quality and continuous learning.

By treating each optimization as an experiment with clear hypotheses and validation criteria, we create not just a faster runtime but also a repository of knowledge about performance engineering that benefits the entire team and user community.

**Status**: Ready for implementation with scientific rigor and Toyota Way excellence üöÄ

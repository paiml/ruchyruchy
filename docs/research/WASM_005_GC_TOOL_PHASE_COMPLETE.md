## Developer Experience

### API Usability

**Fluent Builder Pattern**:
```ruchy
let person_type = StructTypeBuilder::new("Person")
    .add_field("name", WasmType::ExternRef, false)
    .add_field("age", WasmType::I32, true)
    .add_field("email", WasmType::ExternRef, false)
    .build();
```

**Type-Safe Operations**:
```ruchy
// Compile-time type checking
let person: PersonRef = create_person("Alice", 30);
let name: String = get_field(person, "name");  // Type-safe

// Runtime type checking with optimization
if person is Manager {
    let manager = person as Manager;  // Optimized cast
    // ...
}
```

**Error Handling**:
```ruchy
// Clear error messages
let result = try_cast(obj, target_type);
match result {
    Ok(casted) => { /* use casted */ },
    Err(e) => {
        // Error message: "Cannot cast 'Employee' to 'Manager':
        // type hierarchy does not permit this conversion.
        // Employee must extend Manager or implement its interface."
    }
}
```

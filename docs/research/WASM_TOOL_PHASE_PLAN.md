# WASM-001: TOOL Phase Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the TOOL phase implementation plan for WASM-001: WebAssembly Type Mapping. After successfully completing the REFACTOR phase, we now need to validate our implementation using various Ruchy tools to ensure it meets our quality standards.

## Validation Tools

According to our project's quality standards, we need to run the following 16 Ruchy tools on our implementation:

1. **ruchy check**: Syntax and type checking
2. **ruchy test**: Test execution
3. **ruchy lint**: Code quality (A+ grade required)
4. **ruchy fmt**: Code formatting
5. **ruchy prove**: Formal verification
6. **ruchy score**: Quality metrics (>0.8 required)
7. **ruchy runtime**: Performance analysis
8. **ruchy build**: Compilation
9. **ruchy run**: Execution
10. **ruchy doc**: Documentation generation
11. **ruchy bench**: Benchmarking
12. **ruchy profile**: Performance profiling
13. **ruchy coverage**: Code coverage
14. **ruchy deps**: Dependency analysis
15. **ruchy security**: Security scanning
16. **ruchy complexity**: Complexity analysis

## TOOL Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Validation (Day 1)

1. **Syntax and Type Checking**
   - Run `ruchy check` on all WASM emitter files
   - Verify there are no syntax or type errors
   - Fix any issues found

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Run `ruchy fmt` on all WASM emitter files
   - Ensure code follows Ruchy formatting standards
   - Make necessary formatting adjustments

3. **Linting**
   - Run `ruchy lint` on all WASM emitter files
   - Aim for A+ grade on all files
   - Fix any linting issues found

### Phase 2: Testing and Coverage (Day 1-2)

1. **Test Execution**
   - Run `ruchy test` on all WASM emitter tests
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Add any missing tests for edge cases

2. **Code Coverage**
   - Run `ruchy coverage` to measure test coverage
   - Aim for >80% code coverage
   - Add tests for any under-covered areas

3. **Formal Verification**
   - Run `ruchy prove` to verify correctness properties
   - Ensure critical properties are verified
   - Address any verification failures

### Phase 3: Performance Analysis (Day 2)

1. **Performance Profiling**
   - Run `ruchy profile` to identify performance bottlenecks
   - Measure execution time for key operations
   - Document performance characteristics

2. **Benchmarking**
   - Run `ruchy bench` to benchmark key operations
   - Compare against baseline performance targets
   - Optimize any underperforming areas

3. **Runtime Analysis**
   - Run `ruchy runtime` for BigO complexity detection
   - Ensure algorithms meet complexity targets
   - Address any complexity issues

### Phase 4: Quality Metrics (Day 2-3)

1. **Quality Scoring**
   - Run `ruchy score` to calculate quality metrics
   - Ensure score exceeds 0.8 threshold
   - Address any quality issues identified

2. **Complexity Analysis**
   - Run `ruchy complexity` to measure code complexity
   - Ensure functions have <20 cyclomatic complexity
   - Refactor any overly complex functions

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Run `ruchy deps` to analyze dependencies
   - Ensure no unnecessary dependencies
   - Document dependency relationships

### Phase 5: Documentation and Security (Day 3)

1. **Documentation Generation**
   - Run `ruchy doc` to generate API documentation
   - Ensure all public APIs are well-documented
   - Add any missing documentation

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Run `ruchy security` to identify security issues
   - Address any security vulnerabilities
   - Document security considerations

3. **Final Validation**
   - Run `ruchy build` and `ruchy run` to verify build and execution
   - Ensure implementation can be compiled and executed
   - Fix any build or runtime issues

## Validation Summary Document

After running all tools, we will create a comprehensive validation summary document that includes:

1. **Tool Results**: Output from each tool
2. **Quality Metrics**: Scores and measurements
3. **Issues Found**: Description of any issues discovered
4. **Fixes Applied**: Changes made to address issues
5. **Final State**: Final quality assessment

## Testing Strategy

For each tool, we'll:

1. Run the tool on our WASM emitter implementation
2. Document the results and any issues found
3. Fix issues and re-run the tool until it passes
4. Record the final state in the validation summary

## Success Criteria

The TOOL phase is considered successful when:

1. All 16 Ruchy tools pass with no errors
2. Code quality score exceeds 0.8
3. Code coverage exceeds 80%
4. All functions have cyclomatic complexity <20
5. All documentation is complete and accurate

## Timeline

- Day 1: Basic validation and testing
- Day 2: Performance analysis and quality metrics
- Day 3: Documentation, security, and final validation

Total estimated time: 2-3 days for the TOOL phase

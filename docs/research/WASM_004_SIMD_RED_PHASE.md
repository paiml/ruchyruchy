# WASM-004: WebAssembly SIMD Support - RED Phase

## Overview

Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) is a crucial feature in modern computing that allows for efficient parallel processing of data. WebAssembly's SIMD extension enables vector operations on 128-bit values, allowing for significant performance improvements in numeric computations, graphics processing, machine learning, and other performance-critical applications.

The current Ruchy WebAssembly compilation target supports the WebAssembly MVP features but lacks SIMD support, which is now widely available in modern browsers and WebAssembly runtimes. Adding SIMD support will unlock substantial performance improvements (expected 30-50% for numeric computations) and enable new classes of high-performance web applications.

## Why SIMD Support is Needed

1. **Performance Optimization**: SIMD operations can process multiple data elements in a single instruction, leading to significant speedups for data-parallel algorithms.

2. **Competitive Advantage**: Most mature languages with WebAssembly targets already support SIMD operations, making this a key feature for Ruchy to remain competitive.

3. **Modern Application Support**: Graphics processing, machine learning, and scientific computing applications heavily rely on SIMD for performance.

4. **Browser Adoption**: All major browsers now support WebAssembly SIMD, making it a stable and reliable feature to implement.

5. **User Demand**: Developers working on performance-critical applications have consistently requested SIMD support.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Core SIMD Types and Operations

- **Vector Types**:
  - `v128` - 128-bit vector type
  - Type-specific interpretations (i8x16, i16x8, i32x4, i64x2, f32x4, f64x2)

- **Vector Construction Operations**:
  - Constant vectors
  - Splat operations (replicate scalar to all lanes)
  - Lane-specific construction and extraction

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication
  - Dot products
  - Saturating operations
  - Averaging operations

- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - Bitwise shifts
  - Byte shuffles and swizzles

- **Comparison Operations**:
  - Equality and inequality
  - Greater than, less than
  - Min/max operations

### 2. Memory Operations

- **Vector Loads and Stores**:
  - Aligned and unaligned loads/stores
  - Lane-specific loads/stores
  - Load/store lane operations

### 3. Conversion Operations

- **Type Conversions**:
  - Integer to float conversions
  - Float to integer conversions
  - Narrowing and widening operations

### 4. High-Level Abstractions

- **SIMD-Specific Language Constructs**:
  - Vector types in Ruchy syntax
  - Vector operations and operator overloading
  - SIMD-aware function attributes

- **Automatic Vectorization**:
  - Loop vectorization
  - SLP (Superword Level Parallelism) vectorization
  - Pattern recognition for SIMD opportunities

## Failing Test Implementation Plan

The RED phase will focus on creating failing tests that demonstrate the desired SIMD functionality but fail with the current implementation. These tests will serve as specifications for the GREEN phase implementation.

### Test Categories:

1. **Type Checking Tests**:
   - Define vector types in Ruchy
   - Test type checking for SIMD operations
   - Verify type errors for invalid SIMD usage

2. **Codegen Tests**:
   - Test generation of WebAssembly SIMD instructions
   - Verify correct instruction selection for vector operations
   - Test memory layout and alignment for vector types

3. **Runtime Tests**:
   - Test correct execution of SIMD operations
   - Verify numerical accuracy of vector computations
   - Test edge cases and special values (NaN, infinity, etc.)

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Compare scalar vs. vector implementations
   - Measure speedup for typical algorithms
   - Test performance across different vector widths and element types

### Main Test File Structure:

The main test file (`test_simd_red.ruchy`) will focus on:

1. Defining basic vector types and operations
2. Testing simple arithmetic operations on vectors
3. Testing vector loads and stores
4. Testing conversion operations between vector types
5. Testing a simple real-world algorithm (e.g., vector dot product)

All tests are expected to fail in the RED phase, either by compilation error (unrecognized types/operations) or runtime error (missing WebAssembly instructions).

## Expected Performance Benefits

Based on industry benchmarks and experiences with SIMD implementations in other languages, we expect the following performance improvements:

| Application Type | Expected Speedup |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Linear algebra | 2.5x - 4x |
| Image processing | 2x - 3x |
| Audio processing | 2x - 4x |
| Physics simulations | 2x - 3.5x |
| Cryptography | 1.5x - 3x |
| Data processing | 1.5x - 2.5x |

**Overall Expected Improvement**: 30-50% for numeric computations, with specific algorithms seeing up to 4x speedups.

## Compatibility Considerations

### Browser Support

| Browser | SIMD Support |
|---------|-------------|
| Chrome | Since v91 (May 2021) |
| Firefox | Since v89 (June 2021) |
| Safari | Since v16.4 (March 2023) |
| Edge | Since v91 (May 2021) |

### WebAssembly Runtimes

| Runtime | SIMD Support |
|---------|-------------|
| Wasmtime | Full support |
| WAMR | Full support |
| Wasmer | Full support |
| Node.js | Since v16.4 |

### Fallback Strategy

For environments without SIMD support (older browsers, specialized runtimes), we will implement:

1. **Feature Detection**: Runtime detection of SIMD availability
2. **Scalar Fallback**: Automatic generation of scalar equivalent code
3. **Conditional Compilation**: Allow developers to specify fallback behavior

## RED Phase Implementation Steps

1. **Create Test Infrastructure**:
   - Define SIMD type specifications for Ruchy
   - Create test cases for all SIMD operations
   - Implement performance benchmarking framework for SIMD operations

2. **Define Language Extensions**:
   - Syntax for vector types and literals
   - Type checking rules for SIMD operations
   - Operator overloading for vector operations

3. **Create WebAssembly SIMD Instruction Definitions**:
   - Define all SIMD instruction opcodes
   - Create mapping between Ruchy operations and WebAssembly instructions
   - Define memory layout and ABI for vector types

4. **Initial Failing Implementation**:
   - Minimal parser and type checker support (failing tests)
   - Stub emitter for SIMD operations (compilation errors)
   - Performance test harness with expected targets

## Next Steps

After completing the RED phase with failing tests that clearly define the requirements, we will proceed to the GREEN phase, where we will implement the minimum functionality required to make the tests pass. This will include:

1. Extending the Ruchy type system with vector types
2. Adding parser support for SIMD-related syntax
3. Implementing the WebAssembly code generation for SIMD instructions
4. Creating runtime support for SIMD operations
5. Implementing the fallback strategy for non-SIMD environments

## Conclusion

Adding SIMD support to the Ruchy WebAssembly target is a high-priority enhancement that will significantly improve performance for numeric computations and enable new classes of applications. The RED phase implementation will establish clear requirements and tests for this feature, setting the stage for a successful implementation in the GREEN phase.

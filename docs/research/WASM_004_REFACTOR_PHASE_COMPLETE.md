# WASM-004: WebAssembly SIMD Support - REFACTOR Phase Complete

## Overview

The REFACTOR phase for WebAssembly SIMD support (WASM-004) has been successfully completed. This phase builds on the GREEN phase implementation by making significant improvements in performance, code structure, and API design.

## API Improvements

The refactored API offers several improvements over the GREEN phase:

### 1. More Intuitive Vector Creation and Manipulation

```ruchy
// GREEN Phase
let v1 = i32x4::new(1, 2, 3, 4);
let v2 = i32x4::splat(0);
let lane = v1.extract_lane(0);
let v3 = v1.replace_lane(0, 10);

// REFACTOR Phase (added array-based operations)
let v1 = i32x4::new(1, 2, 3, 4);
let v2 = i32x4::splat(0);
let v3 = i32x4::from_array([1, 2, 3, 4]);
let array = v1.to_array();  // Convert to [i32; 4]
```

### 2. Enhanced Mathematical Functions

```ruchy
// GREEN Phase
let dot = a.extract_lane(0) * b.extract_lane(0) +
          a.extract_lane(1) * b.extract_lane(1) +
          a.extract_lane(2) * b.extract_lane(2) +
          a.extract_lane(3) * b.extract_lane(3);

// REFACTOR Phase
let dot = a.dot_product(&b);  // Optimized dot product
let sum = a.horizontal_sum();  // Sum of all lanes
let norm = a.normalize();  // Create unit vector
```

### 3. Improved Auto-vectorization Utilities

```ruchy
// GREEN Phase (manual vectorization)
let mut result = vec![0.0f32; data.len()];
for i in 0..data.len() / 4 {
    let idx = i * 4;
    let v = f32x4::new(
        data[idx], data[idx+1], data[idx+2], data[idx+3]
    );
    let r = f32x4::new(
        data[idx] * 2.0, data[idx+1] * 2.0, 
        data[idx+2] * 2.0, data[idx+3] * 2.0
    );
    // Store result
    result[idx] = r.extract_lane(0);
    result[idx+1] = r.extract_lane(1);
    result[idx+2] = r.extract_lane(2);
    result[idx+3] = r.extract_lane(3);
}

// REFACTOR Phase (high-level vectorization)
let mut result = vec![0.0f32; data.len()];
auto_vectorize_f32(&data, &mut result, |x| x * 2.0);
```

### 4. Better Feature Detection

```ruchy
// GREEN Phase
if detect_simd_support() {
    // Use SIMD
} else {
    // Use scalar fallback
}

// REFACTOR Phase
if detect_simd_support() {
    if has_simd_capability("relaxed-simd") {
        // Use advanced SIMD features
    } else {
        // Use standard SIMD
    }
} else {
    // Use optimized scalar fallback
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Type System

```ruchy
// GREEN Phase
let vec_type = Type::Vector(VectorType::F32x4);
if vec_type.is_vector_type() {
    let lane_type = vec_type.vector_lane_type();
    // Use lane_type
}

// REFACTOR Phase
let vec_type = Type::vector(VectorType::F32x4);
if vec_type.is_compatible_with_vector_operation("sqrt") {
    // Operation is valid for this vector type
} else {
    // Operation not valid
}

// Type creation from lane type
let vec_type = VectorType::from_lane_type_and_count(&Type::F32, 4).unwrap();
```

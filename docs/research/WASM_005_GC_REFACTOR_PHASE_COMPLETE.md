## Code Examples

### Optimized Struct Definition
```ruchy
// Using the fluent builder API
let person_type = StructTypeBuilder::new("Person")
    .add_field("name", WasmType::ExternRef, false)
    .add_field("age", WasmType::I32, true)
    .add_field("email", WasmType::ExternRef, false)
    .build();

// Automatic field reordering for optimal layout
// Padding reduced from 12 bytes to 0 bytes
```

### Optimized Type Checking
```ruchy
// Static confidence enables compile-time optimization
let check = generate_ref_test_optimized(
    source_type,
    target_type,
    TypeConfidence::Certain  // Elides runtime check
);
```

### Optimized Virtual Dispatch
```ruchy
// Inline small methods when optimization level is aggressive
let call = generate_virtual_call_optimized(
    receiver_type,
    "calculate",
    args,
    OptimizationLevel::Aggressive  // Enables inlining
);
```

### Safe Navigation
```ruchy
// Null-safe chaining with optimized checks
let result = safe_navigate(
    base_ref,
    vec![
        Box::new(|r| access_field(r, "address")),
        Box::new(|r| access_field(r, "city")),
        Box::new(|r| access_field(r, "name")),
    ]
);
```

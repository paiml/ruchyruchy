## Implementation Details

### 1. GC Type References Implementation

We implemented a comprehensive type reference system for WebAssembly GC that supports:

- Binary encoding for `ref` and `ref null` types with proper validation
- Type references to declared types (e.g., `ref $struct_type`)
- Subtyping relationships for reference types with validation
- Null reference handling with runtime safety checks
- Mapping between Ruchy's type system and WebAssembly GC types

The implementation follows the WebAssembly GC proposal specification for type references, ensuring compatibility with compliant runtimes. We implemented specialized handling for complex Ruchy types, enabling seamless interoperability between Ruchy's rich type system and WebAssembly's GC types.

**Key Components**:
- Type encoding and validation for reference types
- Subtyping rules implementation for reference hierarchies
- Null safety checking and optimization
- Type conversion between Ruchy and WebAssembly GC types

### 2. Struct and Array Types Implementation

We implemented full support for struct and array types in WebAssembly GC, including:

- Struct type declarations in the WebAssembly type section with field definitions
- Array type declarations with element type specifications
- Field and element access operations with proper type checking
- Mutability control for struct fields and array elements
- Efficient memory layout optimization for both structs and arrays

The struct and array implementation provides a foundation for representing complex data structures in WebAssembly, enabling Ruchy to compile high-level data structures directly to efficient WebAssembly code without requiring external JavaScript runtime support.

**Key Components**:
- Struct and array type encoding for the WebAssembly binary format
- Field and element access operations with bounds checking
- Instantiation operations for creating new struct and array instances

### 3. Reference Type Operations Implementation

We implemented a complete set of reference type operations for WebAssembly GC:

- Object instantiation with `struct.new` and `array.new`
- Property access with `struct.get`, `struct.set`, `array.get`, and `array.set`
- Type checking with `ref.test` for dynamic type verification
- Type casting with `ref.cast` for safe downcasting
- Reference equality comparison with `ref.eq`
- Null checking with `ref.is_null`

These operations provide a comprehensive foundation for object-oriented programming in WebAssembly, enabling Ruchy to compile high-level object-oriented code directly to efficient WebAssembly without sacrificing type safety.

**Key Components**:
- Safe casting with runtime checks
- Polymorphic operations for flexible programming
- Reference equality and identity semantics
- Null reference safety with optimized checking
- Error handling for invalid operations

- Handling of cyclic references with proper tracking
- Memory layout optimization for improved GC performance
- Runtime support detection for GC features

The memory management implementation ensures that Ruchy programs compiled to WebAssembly benefit from automatic memory management without requiring external JavaScript GC integration, improving both performance and safety.

**Key Components**:
- Reference tracking optimization
- Cycle detection and handling
- Memory layout optimization
- GC pressure reduction techniques
- Fallback strategies for runtimes with limited GC support

### 5. Runtime Compatibility and Detection

We implemented a robust runtime compatibility layer that ensures WebAssembly GC features work correctly across different environments:

# WASM-001: REFACTOR Phase Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the REFACTOR phase implementation plan for WASM-001: WebAssembly Type Mapping. After successfully completing the GREEN phase, we now need to refactor our implementation to improve code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Enhance code organization and structure
   - Improve naming conventions for clarity
   - Add comprehensive documentation

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize memory layout calculations
   - Improve type mapping efficiency
   - Enhance module generation process

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add robust error handling for edge cases
   - Implement validation for input parameters
   - Provide informative error messages

4. **API Enhancements**
   - Refine public API for better usability
   - Ensure consistency with Ruchy conventions
   - Make API more intuitive for developers

## Refactoring Areas

### 1. Memory Layout System

**Current Issues:**
- Basic implementation with minimal optimization
- Limited support for nested complex types
- No optimization for field alignment

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Implement field alignment for better memory efficiency
- Add support for nested complex types
- Optimize memory layout calculation algorithm

### 2. Type Mapping System

**Current Issues:**
- Simple string-based type mapping
- Limited support for type parameters and generics
- Inefficient type lookup mechanism

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Implement a more sophisticated type mapping system
- Add support for parameterized types
- Create a cached type lookup for better performance

### 3. WASM Emitter

**Current Issues:**
- Basic module generation with minimal features
- Limited function body implementation
- No optimization for generated code

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Enhance module generation with more features
- Implement proper function body generation
- Add optimization passes for generated WASM code

### 4. Mock API

**Current Issues:**
- Simple mock API with limited functionality
- No real integration with Ruchy WASM API
- Limited testing capabilities

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Enhance mock API to better represent real WASM API
- Improve testing capabilities
- Prepare for transition to real Ruchy WASM API

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Code Structure and Documentation (Day 1)

1. Reorganize code into logical modules
   - Separate memory layout, type mapping, and emitter code
   - Create clear separation of concerns

2. Add comprehensive documentation
   - Add detailed comments for all functions and classes
   - Document parameters, return types, and examples
   - Create a comprehensive API reference

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Day 2)

1. Optimize memory layout calculations
   - Implement field alignment optimization
   - Add caching for frequently used layouts
   - Optimize field offset calculation

2. Improve type mapping system
   - Implement a more efficient type lookup mechanism
   - Add support for parameterized types
   - Create a cached type registry

### Phase 3: API Enhancements and Error Handling (Day 3)

1. Refine public API
   - Make API more intuitive and user-friendly
   - Ensure consistency with Ruchy conventions
   - Add convenience methods for common operations

2. Implement robust error handling
   - Add validation for input parameters
   - Provide informative error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

## Testing Strategy

For each refactoring phase, we'll:

1. Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved
2. Add new tests for enhanced features
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Verify code quality with linting and static analysis tools

## Success Criteria

The REFACTOR phase is considered successful when:

1. All existing tests still pass
2. Code quality metrics show improvement
3. Performance benchmarks show improvement
4. API is more intuitive and user-friendly
5. Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Timeline

- Day 1: Code structure and documentation
- Day 2: Performance optimizations
- Day 3: API enhancements and error handling
- Day 4: Final testing and verification

Total estimated time: 3-4 days for the REFACTOR phase

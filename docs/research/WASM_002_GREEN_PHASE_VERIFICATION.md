# WASM-002: Closure Compilation - GREEN Phase Verification

## Test Execution Results

| Test Case | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| test_counter_closure | ✅ PASS | Basic closure with captured variable |
| test_nested_closures | ✅ PASS | Nested closure (function returning a closure) |
| test_multiple_captures | ✅ PASS | Closures capturing multiple variables |
| test_closure_as_argument | ✅ PASS | Function taking a closure as argument |
| test_closure_in_data_structure | ✅ PASS | Storing closures in arrays |
| test_closure_environment | ✅ PASS | Creating and manipulating closure environments |
| test_closure_type_mapping | ✅ PASS | Mapping closure types to WASM types |
| test_closure_code_generation | ✅ PASS | Generating WASM code for closures |

## Verification Criteria

The GREEN phase implementation for WASM-002 has been verified against the following criteria:

### 1. Functionality Verification

- ✅ **Closure Environment**: Correctly manages captured variables and memory layout
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Properly allocates memory for closure records
- ✅ **Function Table**: Successfully creates function tables for indirect calls
- ✅ **Closure Invocation**: Correctly generates code for calling closures
- ✅ **Type Mapping**: Accurately maps Ruchy closure types to WebAssembly

### 2. Compatibility Verification

- ✅ **Existing WASM Emitter**: Works with the existing WebAssembly emitter
- ✅ **Type System**: Compatible with the Ruchy type system
- ✅ **Memory Model**: Follows WebAssembly's linear memory model
- ✅ **Function Calling Convention**: Adheres to WebAssembly function calling conventions

### 3. Code Quality Verification

- ✅ **Completeness**: Implements all required functionality
- ✅ **Correctness**: Passes all test cases
- ✅ **Clarity**: Code is readable and well-documented
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Implementation is as simple as possible while meeting requirements

## Technical Verification Details

### Memory Model Verification

The implementation correctly represents closures as records in linear memory:

```
Closure Record:
+----------------+
| Function Index | 4 bytes
+----------------+
| Captured Var 1 | Variable size
+----------------+
| Captured Var 2 | Variable size
+----------------+
| ...            |
+----------------+
```

### Function Table Verification

The implementation correctly generates function tables for indirect calls:

```wasm
(table funcref
  (elem $closure_impl_0 $closure_impl_1 ...)
)
```

### Closure Invocation Verification

The implementation correctly generates code for calling closures indirectly:

```wasm
;; Load function index
local.get $closure_ptr
i32.load

;; Call function indirectly with closure pointer as first arg
call_indirect (param i32 ...) (result ...)
```

## Conclusion

The GREEN phase implementation for WASM-002: Closure Compilation has been successfully completed and verified. The implementation provides all the functionality required by the RED phase tests and establishes a solid foundation for the REFACTOR and TOOL phases.

The implementation takes a minimal approach while ensuring all requirements are met. It correctly handles closure environment management, memory allocation, function table generation, and closure invocation.

The code is now ready for the REFACTOR phase, where we'll focus on improving code quality, performance, and maintainability.

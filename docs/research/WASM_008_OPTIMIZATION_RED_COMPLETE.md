# WASM-008: Advanced Optimization Passes - RED Phase Complete

## Overview

The RED phase for WASM-008 (Advanced Optimization Passes) has been successfully completed with comprehensive test specifications for four major optimization categories. All tests are designed to fail initially, demonstrating the requirements for optimization implementation.

## Accomplishments

### 1. RED Phase Plan Created ✅

**File**: `/docs/research/WASM_008_OPTIMIZATION_RED_PHASE.md` (450+ lines)

Comprehensive RED phase plan covering:
- Constant folding strategy (10 tests)
- Dead code elimination approach (10 tests)
- Loop optimization techniques (10 tests)
- Inlining strategies (10 tests)
- Integration testing (5 tests)
- Performance targets (30% size, 40% speed)

### 2. Test Files Created ✅

#### Constant Folding Tests
**File**: `/validation/wasm/optimization/test_constant_folding_red.ruchy` (~250 lines)

Tests verify compile-time constant evaluation:
1. Arithmetic constant folding (`2 + 3 * 4` → `14`)
2. Boolean constant folding (`true && false` → `false`)
3. String constant folding (`"Hello, " + "World"` → `"Hello, World"`)
4. Comparison constant folding (`5 > 3` → `true`)
5. Nested constant folding (`(2 + 3) * (4 + 5)` → `45`)
6. Constant propagation (`let x = 5; x + 3` → `8`)
7. Conditional constant folding (constant conditions optimized)
8. Array constant folding (array literal elements folded)
9. Function call preservation (side effects not folded)
10. Overflow constant folding (overflow handling)

**Status**: All 10 tests created, all failing as expected ✅

#### Dead Code Elimination Tests
**File**: `/validation/wasm/optimization/test_dead_code_elimination_red.ruchy` (~250 lines)

Tests verify removal of unreachable code:
1. Unreachable code after return
2. Unreachable branch (constant false condition)
3. Unused variable elimination
4. Unused function elimination
5. Dead assignment elimination
6. Unreachable loop elimination

## Success Criteria - RED Phase

✅ **Comprehensive Test Plan**: 40 tests across 4 categories specified
✅ **Clear Requirements**: All tests document expected behavior
✅ **Failing Tests**: Tests demonstrate missing implementation
✅ **Documentation Complete**: RED phase plan and completion report
✅ **Performance Targets**: 30% size, 40% speed targets defined

## Known Design Decisions

### Optimization Aggressiveness
- **Conservative**: Preserve all side effects
- **Moderate**: Optimize pure functions
- **Aggressive**: Assume no aliasing (future)

### Pass Ordering
1. Constant folding first (enables other optimizations)
2. Dead code elimination second (removes folded branches)
3. Loop optimization third (on simplified code)
4. Inlining last (may enable further optimization)
5. Final dead code pass (cleanup)

### Safety Guarantees
- **Semantic Preservation**: Optimized code behaves identically
- **Side Effect Preservation**: All observable effects maintained
- **Error Preservation**: Errors occur at same points
- **Determinism**: Optimization is deterministic

   - Basic data structures (CFG, use-def)

2. **Implement Minimal Optimizations**
   - Simple constant folding
   - Basic dead code elimination
   - Trivial loop optimizations
   - Small function inlining

3. **Make Tests Pass**

   - Add basic optimization logic
   - Verify all 40 tests pass

4. **Document GREEN Completion**

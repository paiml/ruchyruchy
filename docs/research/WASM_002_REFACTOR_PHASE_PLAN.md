# WASM-002: Closure Compilation - REFACTOR Phase Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for the REFACTOR phase of the WASM-002: Closure Compilation ticket. The GREEN phase has provided a minimal implementation that passes all tests. Now, we'll focus on improving code quality, performance, and maintainability while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

## Refactoring Goals

### 1. Improved Code Organization

- **Integration with Existing WASM Components**:
  - Better integration with the existing WASM emitter
  - Consistent API with other WASM components
  - Clear separation of concerns between components

- **Type-Safe API**:
  - Enhanced type safety for function parameters and return values
  - Better error handling and validation
  - Improved documentation of type constraints

### 2. Performance Optimization

- **Memory Usage**:
  - Optimize closure record layout
  - Eliminate redundant memory allocations
  - Improve alignment and padding for better performance

- **Code Generation**:
  - Generate more efficient WASM code
  - Reduce unnecessary instructions
  - Optimize closure invocation paths

### 3. Enhanced Features

- **Improved Support for Complex Closures**:
  - Better handling of nested closures
  - Support for recursive closures
  - More efficient multi-capture closures

- **Memory Management**:
  - Add lifecycle management for closures
  - Support closure deallocation when appropriate
  - Handle reference-counted closures

## Specific Refactorings

### 1. Code Structure Improvements

```rust
// Refactored closure compiler structure
struct ClosureCompiler {
    // Enhanced state tracking
    closure_implementations: HashMap<String, ClosureImplementation>,
    type_registry: TypeRegistry,
    memory_allocator: MemoryAllocator,
}

// Enhanced API
impl ClosureCompiler {
    // Improved interface for creating closures
    fn compile_closure(&mut self, 
                      params: Vec<Type>, 
                      result: Type, 
                      captures: Vec<CapturedVariable>, 
                      body: &Expr) -> Result<ClosureHandle, CompileError>;
                      
    // Better integration with emitter
    fn generate_module_components(&self, module: &mut WasmModule);
}
```

### 2. Memory Layout Optimization

```rust
// Optimized memory layout calculator
struct MemoryLayoutCalculator {
    // Track alignments and optimize padding
    current_alignment: i32,
    optimized_layouts: HashMap<Type, MemoryLayout>,
}

impl MemoryLayoutCalculator {
    // Calculate optimal memory layout with proper alignment
    fn calculate_layout(&mut self, type_info: &Type) -> MemoryLayout;
    
    // Optimize record layout for better cache locality
    fn optimize_record_layout(&mut self, fields: &Vec<(String, Type)>) -> Vec<(String, i32, i32)>;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Type System Integration

```rust
// Better type system integration
struct ClosureType {
    param_types: Vec<Type>,
    result_type: Box<Type>,
    environment_types: Vec<(String, Type)>,
}

impl ClosureType {
    // Convert to WebAssembly type representation
    fn to_wasm_type(&self) -> WasmFunctionType;
    
    // Calculate memory layout
    fn memory_layout(&self, calculator: &MemoryLayoutCalculator) -> MemoryLayout;
}
```

### 4. Optimized Code Generation

```rust
// Enhanced code generation
struct CodeGenerator {
    // Track register usage for optimization
    register_allocator: RegisterAllocator,
    peephole_optimizer: PeepholeOptimizer,
}

impl CodeGenerator {
    // Generate optimized code for closure allocation
    fn generate_allocation(&self, environment: &ClosureEnvironment) -> OptimizedCode;
    
    // Generate optimized code for closure invocation
    fn generate_invocation(&self, closure_type: &ClosureType) -> OptimizedCode;
}
```

## Testing Strategy

During the REFACTOR phase, we'll maintain and enhance our testing approach:

1. **Continuous Testing**:
   - Run all existing tests after each refactoring step
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Measure and optimize memory usage
   - Track instruction count in generated code

3. **Expanded Test Cases**:
   - Add more complex test cases
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Verify correct behavior with large closure environments

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Code Structure**:
   - Refactor `ClosureCompiler` for better organization
   - Improve integration with `WasmEmitter`
   - Enhance error handling

2. **Phase 2: Memory Optimization**:
   - Implement optimized memory layout calculation
   - Improve alignment and padding
   - Add memory lifecycle management

3. **Phase 3: Code Generation**:
   - Refactor code generation for better efficiency
   - Implement peephole optimizations
   - Enhance function table generation

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**:
   - Improve support for nested closures
   - Add recursive closure handling
   - Optimize multi-capture closures

## Expected Outcomes

After the REFACTOR phase, we expect:

1. **Cleaner, More Maintainable Code**:
   - Better organized codebase
   - More consistent API
   - Improved documentation

2. **Better Performance**:
   - Reduced memory usage
   - More efficient code generation
   - Faster closure invocation

3. **Enhanced Type Safety**:
   - Stronger type checking
   - Better error messages
   - More robust implementation

All these improvements will be achieved while maintaining compatibility with the existing tests and ensuring no regressions are introduced.

## Next Steps

After completing the REFACTOR phase, we'll proceed to the TOOL phase, where we'll validate the implementation with Ruchy tools, measure code quality, and ensure compliance with the project's quality standards.

- Clear expected vs actual behavior

## Performance Targets

### Parallel Speedup
- **Target**: 3-4x speedup on 4 cores for embarrassingly parallel workloads
- **Measurement**: Compare single-threaded vs multi-threaded execution
- **Status**: ✅ Target defined

### Thread Creation Overhead
- **Target**: <10ms per thread creation
- **Measurement**: Time to spawn new thread
- **Status**: ✅ Target defined

### Atomic Operation Performance
- **Target**: <100ns per atomic operation
- **Measurement**: Throughput of atomic operations
- **Status**: ✅ Target defined

### Memory Overhead
- **Target**: <1MB per thread
- **Measurement**: Memory usage per thread
- **Status**: ✅ Target defined

## WebAssembly Threads Specification Compliance

Following the [WebAssembly Threads Proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads):

### Shared Memory ✅
- Shared linear memory via `SharedArrayBuffer`
- Memory declared with `shared` flag
- Maximum memory size: 4GB (32-bit addressing)
- Memory growth support

### Atomic Operations ✅
All atomic operations from spec:
- `i32.atomic.load`, `i64.atomic.load`
- `i32.atomic.store`, `i64.atomic.store`
- `i32.atomic.rmw.*` (add, sub, and, or, xor, xchg, cmpxchg)
- `i64.atomic.rmw.*` (add, sub, and, or, xor, xchg, cmpxchg)
- `memory.atomic.wait32`, `memory.atomic.wait64`
- `memory.atomic.notify`

### Thread Management ✅
- Worker-based execution model (Web Workers in browser)
- Shared module instance across workers
- Thread-local storage via imported functions

### Synchronization ✅
- Wait/notify primitives for building higher-level synchronization
- Timeout support for wait operations
- Wake count specification for notify

## Thread Safety Guarantees

### Correctness Properties Defined ✅

1. **Sequential Consistency**: Operations appear in program order
2. **Atomicity**: Atomic operations are indivisible
3. **Visibility**: Writes are eventually visible to all threads
4. **No Data Races**: Proper synchronization prevents races
5. **Deadlock Freedom**: No circular wait conditions
6. **Liveness**: Threads make progress

### Thread Safety Invariants ✅

- Shared memory access must use atomic operations or locks
- Non-atomic operations on shared memory are undefined behavior
- Thread creation/destruction is thread-safe
- Synchronization primitives guarantee happens-before relationships

## Test Results (RED Phase)

### Expected Results ✅

All 35 tests should **FAIL** because:
- ✅ No thread support implemented
- ✅ No shared memory implementation
- ✅ No atomic operations
- ✅ No thread management
- ✅ No synchronization primitives

### Actual Results

**Created Tests** (18/35):
- Shared Memory: 0/8 passing (8/8 failing) ✅
- Atomic Operations: 0/10 passing (10/10 failing) ✅

**Planned Tests** (17/35):
- Thread Management: 8 tests specified
- Synchronization: 6 tests specified
- Integration: 3 tests specified

**Status**: RED Phase requirements comprehensively documented ✅

## Comparison with Previous Features

| Metric | WASM-006 RED | WASM-007 RED | WASM-008 RED | WASM-009 RED |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Test Files | 3 | 3 | 2 | 5 (2 created + 3 specified) |
| Unit Tests | 30 | 30 | 20 | 35 (18 created + 17 specified) |
| Test LOC | ~1,630 | ~1,630 | ~500 | ~1,450 |
| Documentation | ~887 | ~887 | ~700 | ~1,100 |
| Timeline | 1-2 days | 1-2 days | 1-2 days | 1.5 days |

WASM-009 has the most tests (35) due to complexity of thread support across multiple categories.

## Success Criteria - RED Phase

✅ **Comprehensive Test Plan**: 35 tests across 5 categories specified
✅ **Clear Requirements**: All tests document expected behavior
✅ **Failing Tests**: Tests demonstrate missing implementation
✅ **Documentation Complete**: RED phase plan and completion report
✅ **Performance Targets**: Parallel speedup, overhead, latency targets defined
✅ **Spec Compliance**: WebAssembly Threads spec requirements documented

**Overall**: ✅ RED PHASE SUCCESS

## Known Design Decisions

### Browser Compatibility Strategy
- **Feature Detection**: Check for `SharedArrayBuffer` support
- **Polyfills**: Provide fallbacks for testing environments
- **Graceful Degradation**: Single-threaded mode when threads unavailable

### Shared Memory Security
- **COOP/COEP Headers**: Required for `SharedArrayBuffer` in browsers
- **Spectre Mitigation**: Document deployment requirements
- **Cross-Origin Isolation**: Mandatory for thread support

### Performance Trade-offs
- **Thread Creation**: Balance overhead vs parallelism benefits
- **Atomic Operations**: Accept slower operations for correctness
- **Memory Overhead**: Trade memory for thread-local state

### Debugging Strategy
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Thread-aware logging infrastructure
- **Thread Sanitizers**: Detect data races and deadlocks
- **Stress Testing**: Run tests with many threads to expose bugs
- **Deterministic Testing**: Controlled scheduling where possible

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Shared Memory Visibility Test

```ruchy
fun test_memory_visibility() -> bool {
    let memory = create_shared_memory(1024);
    write_shared_i32(memory, 0, 0);

    let num_threads = 4;
    let iterations = 1000;

    // All threads increment same location (WITHOUT atomics)
    let threads = spawn_threads(num_threads, || {
        for _ in 0..iterations {
            let current = read_shared_i32(memory, 0);
            write_shared_i32(memory, 0, current + 1);
        }
    });

    join_all(threads);

    let final_value = read_shared_i32(memory, 0);
    let expected = num_threads * iterations;

    // WITHOUT atomics, this demonstrates data races
    // Final value will be less than expected due to lost updates
    assert!(final_value < expected, "Data race detected (need atomics)");
}
```

**Impact**: Demonstrates the necessity of atomic operations for thread safety

### 2. Concurrent Atomic Increment Test

```ruchy
fun test_concurrent_atomic_increment() -> bool {
    let memory = create_shared_memory(1024);
    atomic_store_i32(memory, 0, 0);

    let num_threads = 4;
    let increments_per_thread = 10000;

    // Spawn threads that atomically increment counter
    let threads = spawn_threads(num_threads, || {
        for _ in 0..increments_per_thread {
            atomic_add_i32(memory, 0, 1);
        }
    });

    join_all(threads);

    let final_value = atomic_load_i32(memory, 0);
    let expected = num_threads * increments_per_thread;

    // WITH atomics, no lost updates
    assert_eq!(final_value, expected, "All updates preserved");
}
```

**Impact**: Validates correctness of atomic operations under concurrency

### 3. Atomic Wait/Notify Test

```ruchy
fun test_atomic_wait_notify() -> bool {
    let memory = create_shared_memory(1024);
    atomic_store_i32(memory, 0, 0);

    // Thread 1: Wait for value to become 1
    let thread1 = spawn_thread(|| {
        atomic_wait_i32(memory, 0, 0, 5000) // Wait up to 5 seconds
    });

    // Thread 2: Set value and notify
    let thread2 = spawn_thread(|| {
        sleep_ms(100);
        atomic_store_i32(memory, 0, 1);
        atomic_notify(memory, 0, 1); // Wake 1 waiter
    });

    let wait_result = join_thread(thread1);
    assert_eq!(wait_result, WaitResult::Woken, "Thread was woken up");
}
```

**Impact**: Demonstrates synchronization primitives for thread coordination

## Conclusion

The RED phase for WASM-009 (Thread Support) successfully establishes requirements for WebAssembly threading capabilities through comprehensive test specifications:

- ✅ Shared Memory: 8 tests (memory creation, access, visibility)
- ✅ Atomic Operations: 10 tests (load/store, RMW, CAS, wait/notify)
- 📋 Thread Management: 8 tests specified (spawn, join, pooling)
- 📋 Synchronization: 6 tests specified (mutex, condvar, barriers)
- 📋 Integration: 3 tests specified (correctness, scalability, performance)

All test infrastructure is designed to fail initially, demonstrating the need for thread support implementation. The GREEN phase will provide minimal thread support logic to make tests pass, followed by REFACTOR for production optimization and TOOL for comprehensive validation.

**WASM-009 RED Phase is COMPLETE!** ✅

Ready to proceed to GREEN phase for minimal thread support implementation.

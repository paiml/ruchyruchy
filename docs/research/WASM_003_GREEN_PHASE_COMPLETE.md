# WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration - GREEN Phase Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the GREEN phase for the WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration ticket. The GREEN phase focused on implementing the unified interface for multi-target compilation defined in the RED phase and making all tests pass with a minimal implementation.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Parser and Type Checker

We implemented a basic parser and type checker to convert Ruchy source code into a shared AST and type environment:

```rust
// Parser for Ruchy code
struct RuchyParser {
    /// Source code to parse
    source: String,
}

// Type checker for Ruchy code
struct RuchyTypeChecker {
    /// AST to type check
    ast: Box<Ast>,
}
```

These components provide a unified front-end for the compilation process, ensuring that all targets work with the same abstract syntax tree and type information.

### 2. Target Emitters

We implemented target-specific emitters for each supported compilation target:

```rust
// WebAssembly emitter implementation
struct WasmEmitterImpl {
    /// Compilation options
    options: CompilationOptions,
}

// TypeScript emitter implementation
struct TypeScriptEmitterImpl {
    /// Compilation options
    options: CompilationOptions,
}

// Rust emitter implementation
struct RustEmitterImpl {
    /// Compilation options
    options: CompilationOptions,
}
```

Each emitter implements the `TargetEmitter` trait defined in the RED phase, providing a consistent interface for code generation across targets.

### 3. Multi-Target Compiler

We implemented the multi-target compiler interface to orchestrate the compilation process:

```rust
// Multi-target compiler implementation
struct MultiTargetCompilerImpl {
    /// Available compilation targets
    emitters: HashMap<CompilationTarget, Box<dyn TargetEmitter>>,
    
    /// Current active target
    active_target: Option<CompilationTarget>,
    
    /// Shared AST representation
    ast: Option<Box<Ast>>,
    
    /// Shared type environment
    type_env: TypeEnvironment,
    
    /// Compilation options
    options: CompilationOptions,
}
```

The compiler manages the full compilation pipeline:
1. Parsing source code into an AST
2. Type checking the AST
3. Selecting target(s) for compilation
4. Configuring compilation options
5. Generating code for the selected target(s)

## Supported Features

The implementation supports the following features across all targets:

### 1. Basic Compilation

All targets can compile simple Ruchy programs:

```rust
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!");
}
```

Each target generates appropriate code:
- WebAssembly: WebAssembly Text Format (WAT) with exported functions
- TypeScript: TypeScript functions with console.log
- Rust: Rust functions with println! macros

### 2. Closures

All targets support compilation of closures, including:
- Simple closures (e.g., counter function)
- Closures with parameters
- Nested closures
- Closures that capture variables from the surrounding scope

```rust
fun make_counter() {
    let mut count = 0;
    return () => {
        count = count + 1;
        count
    };
}
```

Each target has different closure representations:
- WebAssembly: Closure records in linear memory with function tables
- TypeScript: Native JavaScript closures
- Rust: Move closures with appropriate lifetime management

### 3. Type System

All targets support Ruchy's type system:
- Structs
- Enums
- Generic types
- Pattern matching

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

enum Shape {
    Circle { center: Point, radius: f64 },
    Rectangle { top_left: Point, bottom_right: Point },
    Triangle { a: Point, b: Point, c: Point },
}
```

Each target has its own type representation:
- WebAssembly: Memory layouts and structural types
- TypeScript: Interfaces and union types
- Rust: Structs and enums with derive attributes

### 4. Target-Specific Features

The implementation supports target-specific annotations:

```rust
#[target(wasm)]
import wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[target(typescript)]
import { useState } from 'react';

#[target(rust)]
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

This allows developers to use target-specific features while keeping the core code shared across targets.

### 5. Error Handling

All targets support Ruchy's error handling patterns:
- Result type
- Pattern matching on results
- Error propagation

```rust
fun divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, String> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        return Result::Err("Division by zero".to_string());
    }
    return Result::Ok(a / b);
}
```

Each target implements error handling appropriately:
- WebAssembly: Error codes and result structures
- TypeScript: Discriminated unions for Result types
- Rust: Native Result type

## Configuration Options

The implementation supports various configuration options:

### 1. Global Options

- Optimization level (0-3)
- Debug information
- Source maps

### 2. Target-Specific Options

- WebAssembly: Memory size, thread support, etc.
- TypeScript: Module type, target ES version, etc.
- Rust: Edition, crate type, etc.

## Integration with Existing Emitters

The implementation integrates with the existing emitters:

- WebAssembly: Uses the emitter from WASM-002 for closure compilation
- TypeScript: Uses the existing TypeScript emitter for code generation
- Rust: Uses the existing Rust emitter for code generation

This integration ensures consistent behavior across all targets and leverages the work done in previous tickets.

## Test Results

The GREEN phase implementation passes all tests defined in the RED phase:

1. **Basic Compilation**: ✅ PASS
   - Successfully parses and compiles simple programs
   - Generates appropriate code for each target

2. **Target Options**: ✅ PASS
   - Successfully configures global and target-specific options
   - Options affect the generated code appropriately

3. **Closure Compilation**: ✅ PASS

   - Generates appropriate code for each target

6. **Error Handling**: ✅ PASS
   - Successfully compiles error handling code for all targets
   - Handles Result types correctly

7. **Full Compilation Pipeline**: ✅ PASS
   - Successfully runs the full compilation pipeline
   - Generates appropriate metadata for each target

## Compilation Output

The implementation generates structured output for each target:

```rust
struct CompiledOutput {
    /// Target this output was compiled for
    target: CompilationTarget,
    
    /// Main output content (code)
    content: String,
    
    /// Additional files (e.g. header files, type definitions)
    additional_files: HashMap<String, String>,
    
    /// Warnings generated during compilation
    warnings: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Compilation metadata
    metadata: CompilationMetadata,
}
```

This structure includes:
- The main code file
- Additional files (e.g., TypeScript definition files, Cargo.toml)
- Warnings about target-specific features
- Metadata about the compilation process

## Next Steps

The GREEN phase provides a working implementation of the multi-target compiler. The next steps will be:

### 1. REFACTOR Phase

Improve the implementation for better code quality and performance:
- Optimize the compilation process
- Enhance error handling and reporting
- Improve code organization
- Add more comprehensive documentation

### 2. TOOL Phase

Validate the implementation with Ruchy tools:
- Formal verification with property testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Code quality assessment
- Integration testing

## Conclusion

The GREEN phase for WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration is now complete. The implementation successfully compiles Ruchy code to WebAssembly, TypeScript, and Rust using a unified interface. All tests from the RED phase now pass, demonstrating the functionality of the multi-target compiler.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for further refinement in the REFACTOR phase and validation in the TOOL phase.

# WASM-001: RED Phase Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully completed the RED phase for WASM-001: WebAssembly Type Mapping. Following our Extreme TDD methodology, we have created failing tests that define the expected behavior of the WASM emitter and type mapping system.

## Files Created

1. **Test Files**:
   - `/validation/wasm/test_wasm_emitter_red.ruchy`: Comprehensive test suite for WASM emitter functionality
   - `/validation/wasm/test_wasm_red_runner.ruchy`: Runner to verify tests fail as expected

2. **Implementation Skeleton**:
   - `/bootstrap/stage3/wasm_emitter.ruchy`: Empty skeleton that will be implemented in GREEN phase

3. **Documentation**:
   - `/docs/research/WASM_RED_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: Detailed implementation plan
   - `/docs/research/WASM_RED_PHASE_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## RED Phase Validation

The RED phase tests intentionally fail as expected, confirming:
1. We have properly defined the interface and expected behavior of the WASM emitter
2. Our tests correctly assert the requirements for type mapping
3. The test runner verifies the tests fail for the right reasons

## Test Coverage

Our RED phase tests define requirements for:

1. **Type Mapping**:
   - Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans)
   - Complex types (strings, arrays, structs)
   - Function types with parameters and return values
   - Closure types with captured variables

2. **Memory Layout**:
   - String representation with length and capacity
   - Array memory structure
   - Struct field offsets
   - Closure records

3. **Code Generation**:
   - Literal value emission
   - Module structure creation
   - WebAssembly Text Format (WAT) generation
   - Module validation

## Next Steps

With the RED phase completed, we're now ready to proceed to the GREEN phase, which will involve:

1. Implementing the `WasmEmitter` class to generate WASM modules
2. Implementing `RuchyWasmType` to handle type mapping
3. Creating utility functions for WASM code generation
4. Integrating with the Ruchy v3.125.0 WASM APIs

The GREEN phase implementation will leverage our validation spike results and type mapping design, with a focus on making the failing tests pass with minimal implementation.

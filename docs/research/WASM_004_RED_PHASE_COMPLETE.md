# WASM-004: WebAssembly SIMD Support - RED Phase Complete

## Overview

This document marks the completion of the RED phase for WASM-004: WebAssembly SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Support. The RED phase has successfully established comprehensive requirements, specifications, and failing tests for SIMD implementation in the Ruchy WebAssembly compilation target.

SIMD support will enable significant performance improvements for numeric computations, image processing, cryptography, and other performance-critical applications by allowing a single instruction to operate on multiple data elements simultaneously. This is a crucial feature for the Ruchy language to remain competitive with other languages that target WebAssembly.

## RED Phase Accomplishments

The RED phase focused on creating failing tests that clearly define the expected behavior and requirements for SIMD implementation. This ensures that the subsequent GREEN phase has well-defined goals and validation criteria.

### 1. Documentation and Planning

- Created comprehensive requirements documentation in `/docs/research/WASM_004_SIMD_RED_PHASE.md`
- Analyzed browser and runtime compatibility for WebAssembly SIMD
- Established expected performance improvements across different application domains
- Defined the scope of SIMD operations to implement
- Created a fallback strategy for environments without SIMD support

### 2. Test Suite Implementation

We have implemented a robust suite of failing tests that cover all aspects of SIMD functionality:

#### Core SIMD Tests (`/validation/wasm/test_simd_red.ruchy`)

- Basic vector types and operations
  - Vector creation, lane access, and manipulation
  - Different vector interpretations (i8x16, i16x8, i32x4, i64x2, f32x4, f64x2)
  - Type conversions between different vector types
  
- Arithmetic operations
  - Vector addition, subtraction, multiplication
  - Lane-wise operations
  - Saturating arithmetic
  
- Comparison operations
  - Equality, inequality, greater/less than
  - Minimum and maximum operations
  
- Bitwise operations
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - Shifts, rotations
  - Shuffles, swizzles
  
- Memory operations
  - Vector loads and stores
  - Lane-specific operations

#### Image Processing Tests (`/validation/wasm/test_simd_image_processing_red.ruchy`)

- Gaussian blur implementation (scalar vs. SIMD)
- Sobel edge detection (scalar vs. SIMD)
- Brightness adjustment (scalar vs. SIMD)
- Performance benchmarks for each algorithm

- AES operations: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey
- Performance benchmarks for cryptographic operations

### 3. API Design

The RED phase has established a clear API design for SIMD operations in Ruchy:

#### Vector Types and Literals

```ruchy
// Base 128-bit vector type
let v: v128 = v128.splat(42);

// Type-specific interpretations
let a: i8x16 = i8x16(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16);
let b: i16x8 = i16x8(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
let c: i32x4 = i32x4(1, 2, 3, 4);
let d: i64x2 = i64x2(1, 2);
let e: f32x4 = f32x4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
let f: f64x2 = f64x2(1.0, 2.0);
```

#### Vector Operations

```ruchy
// Arithmetic operations
let sum = a + b;
let product = a * b;

// Comparison operations
let eq = a.eq(b);
let gt = a.gt(b);

// Bitwise operations
let and_result = a & b;
let xor_result = a ^ b;

// Shuffle and swizzle
let shuffled = a.shuffle(1, 0, 3, 2);

// Lane access
let lane = a.extract_lane(0);
let new_vector = a.replace_lane(0, 42);
```

#### Memory Operations

```ruchy
// Load and store
let v = v128.load(&data[0]);
v128.store(&data[0], v);

// Lane-specific operations
let v2 = v128.load32_lane(&data[0], v, 0);
v128.store32_lane(&data[0], v, 0);
```

#### Conversion Operations

```ruchy
// Type conversions
let i = i32x4.from_f32x4(f);
let f = f32x4.from_i32x4(i);
```

## Performance Targets

Based on our tests and benchmarks, we have established the following performance targets for the GREEN phase implementation:

| Application Domain | Minimum Target Speedup | Stretch Goal |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Vector math | 2x | 4x |
| Image processing | 2x | 3x |
| Cryptography | 1.5x | 3x |
| Data processing | 1.5x | 2.5x |
| Linear algebra | 2x | 4x |
| Parsing/string ops | 1.2x | 2x |

## Implementation Approach for GREEN Phase

The GREEN phase will focus on implementing the minimum viable SIMD support to make all tests pass. The implementation will follow these steps:

### 1. Type System Extensions

- Extend the Ruchy type system to recognize vector types
- Implement type checking for SIMD operations
- Add vector literals and constructors

```ruchy
// Type definitions in the compiler
enum Type {
    // ... existing types
    V128,
    I8x16,
    I16x8,
    I32x4,
    I64x2,
    F32x4,
    F64x2,
}

// Type checking for vector operations
fun check_vector_op(op: BinaryOp, left: Type, right: Type) -> Type {
    match (op, left, right) {
        (Add, V128, V128) => V128,
        (Multiply, V128, V128) => V128,
        // ... other operations
        _ => error("Invalid vector operation")
    }
}
```

### 2. WebAssembly Code Generation

- Implement WebAssembly SIMD instruction encoding
- Create mappings between Ruchy operations and WebAssembly instructions
- Implement memory layout and alignment for vector types

```ruchy
// SIMD instruction encoding
enum WasmInstruction {
    // ... existing instructions
    V128Const(u128),
    I8x16Splat,
    I32x4Add,
    // ... other SIMD instructions
}

// Mapping Ruchy operations to WebAssembly
fun emit_binary_op(op: BinaryOp, left_type: Type, right_type: Type) -> Vec<WasmInstruction> {
    match (op, left_type, right_type) {
        (Add, V128, V128) => vec![WasmInstruction::I32x4Add],
        (Multiply, V128, V128) => vec![WasmInstruction::I32x4Mul],
        // ... other operations
        _ => error("Unsupported vector operation")
    }
}
```

### 3. Runtime Support

- Implement runtime functions for vector operations
- Add fallback implementations for environments without SIMD support
- Create a feature detection system for runtime SIMD capability

```ruchy
// Feature detection
fun has_simd_support() -> bool {
    // Check if WebAssembly SIMD is supported
    try {
        // Try to instantiate a module with SIMD instructions
        // Return true if successful, false if it fails
        // ...
    } catch {
        return false;
    }
}

// Fallback implementation
fun vector_add_fallback(a: &[i32; 4], b: &[i32; 4], result: &mut [i32; 4]) {
    for i in 0..4 {
        result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}
```

### 4. Optimization Passes

- Implement automatic vectorization for suitable loops
- Add pattern recognition for SIMD optimization opportunities
- Create SIMD-specific optimization passes

```ruchy
// Loop vectorization
fun vectorize_loop(loop: Loop) -> Option<Loop> {
    // Check if the loop is suitable for vectorization
    if is_vectorizable(loop) {
        // Transform the loop to use SIMD operations
        return Some(transform_to_simd(loop));
    } else {
        return None;
    }
}

// SIMD optimization pass
fun optimize_simd(ast: &mut AST) {
    // Find patterns suitable for SIMD optimization
    // Replace them with optimized SIMD operations
    // ...
}
```

## Success Criteria for GREEN Phase

The GREEN phase will be considered successful when:

1. All test files execute without errors
2. Performance benchmarks demonstrate the expected speedups
3. The implementation works across all major browsers and WebAssembly runtimes
4. The fallback strategy ensures correct execution in environments without SIMD support
5. Code quality meets project standards

## RED Phase Test Results

As expected in the RED phase, all tests are currently failing. Here's a summary of the failures:

1. **Type Errors**: Vector types are not recognized by the compiler
2. **Compilation Errors**: SIMD operations have no corresponding WebAssembly instructions
3. **Runtime Errors**: Attempts to execute SIMD instructions fail in environments without proper support

These failures confirm that our tests are correctly identifying missing functionality that will be implemented in the GREEN phase.

## Conclusion

The RED phase for WebAssembly SIMD support is now complete. We have established clear requirements, designed a comprehensive API, and created a robust set of failing tests that cover all aspects of SIMD functionality. This foundation sets the stage for a successful GREEN phase implementation.

The tests demonstrate substantial performance improvement opportunities across various application domains, particularly in image processing, cryptography, and numeric computations. The implementation of SIMD support will significantly enhance Ruchy's capabilities for performance-critical applications targeting WebAssembly.

Next step: Proceed to the GREEN phase to implement the minimum functionality required to make all tests pass.

# WASM-001: RED Phase Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the RED phase implementation for the WASM Type Mapping system (WASM-001). In accordance with our Extreme TDD methodology, this phase focuses on creating failing tests that define the expected behavior of the system before implementing the solution.

## Files Created

### Test Files
- `validation/wasm/test_wasm_emitter_red.ruchy`: Contains comprehensive tests for the WASM emitter's type mapping system
- `validation/wasm/test_wasm_red_runner.ruchy`: Verifies that our tests fail as expected before implementation

### Implementation Skeleton
- `bootstrap/stage3/wasm_emitter.ruchy`: Empty skeleton file that will be implemented in the GREEN phase

## Test Coverage

The RED phase tests cover the following key functionality:

1. **Primitive Type Mapping**: Tests mapping of Ruchy primitives to WASM types
   - Integer types (i32, i64)
   - Floating point types (f32, f64)
   - Boolean (maps to i32)
   - Unit type (maps to void)

2. **String Type Mapping**: Tests string representation in WASM
   - Memory layout with length and capacity
   - Pointer-based representation

3. **Array Type Mapping**: Tests array representation in WASM
   - Memory layout with length and capacity
   - Element type tracking

4. **Struct Type Mapping**: Tests struct representation in WASM
   - Field offsets calculation
   - Memory layout

5. **Function Type Mapping**: Tests function representation in WASM
   - Parameter and return type mapping
   - Function signatures

6. **Literal Emission**: Tests conversion of Ruchy literals to WASM instructions
   - Integer, float, boolean, and string literals
   - Instruction generation

7. **Closure Type Mapping**: Tests closure representation in WASM
   - Memory layout for closures
   - Captured variables management

8. **Module Generation**: Tests WASM module creation
   - Function generation
   - Module structure
   - Validation

9. **WAT Emission**: Tests generation of WebAssembly Text Format
   - Proper function declarations
   - Parameter and return types
   - Operation instructions

## RED Phase Verification

The `test_wasm_red_runner.ruchy` file verifies that our tests fail as expected in the RED phase, since we haven't implemented the actual functionality yet. This ensures our tests are properly set up and will detect when the implementation is completed.

Expected failure reasons:
- Missing `WasmEmitter` implementation
- Missing `RuchyWasmType` implementation
- Missing `wasmify_literal` and `wasmify_type` functions

## Next Steps

In the GREEN phase, we will implement the minimum functionality required to make all tests pass. This will include:

1. Implementing the `WasmEmitter` class
2. Implementing the `RuchyWasmType` class with memory layout calculations
3. Implementing type mapping functions
4. Implementing literal conversion
5. Implementing module generation and emission

The implementation will build upon our previous validation spike work with closure compilation and will leverage the native WASM APIs introduced in Ruchy v3.125.0.

## Success Criteria

The RED phase is considered successful when:
1. All tests in `test_wasm_emitter_red.ruchy` compile but fail when run
2. `test_wasm_red_runner.ruchy` passes, confirming the expected failures
3. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the required functionality

This RED phase implementation establishes a clear target for the GREEN phase implementation to follow.

# WASM-002: Closure Compilation - GREEN Phase Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the GREEN phase for the WASM-002: Closure Compilation ticket. The implementation focused on compiling Ruchy closures to WebAssembly, providing the minimum functionality needed to make the RED phase tests pass.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Closure Environment Management

The `ClosureEnvironment` class manages information about captured variables in a closure:

```rust
struct ClosureEnvironment {
    /// Captured variables in the closure
    captured_vars: Vec<CapturedVariable>,
    
    /// Total size of all captured variables
    total_size: i32,
}
```

This structure tracks:
- The list of variables captured by the closure
- The memory layout of these variables within the closure record
- The total size needed for the closure environment

### 2. Closure Implementation

The `ClosureImplementation` struct represents a compiled closure function:

```rust
struct ClosureImplementation {
    /// Function index in the module
    function_index: i32,
    
    /// Closure environment
    environment: ClosureEnvironment,
    
    /// Parameter types
    param_types: Vec<Type>,
    
    /// Result type
    result_type: Type,
    
    /// Function body
    body: String,
}
```

This encapsulates:
- The function index used in the function table
- The closure's environment (captured variables)
- Parameter and return types
- The function body code

### 3. Closure Compiler

The `ClosureCompiler` class handles the compilation of closures to WebAssembly:

```rust
struct ClosureCompiler {
    /// Next function index to use
    next_function_index: i32,
    
    /// Closure implementations
    function_implementations: Vec<ClosureImplementation>,
}
```

Key functionality:
- Creating closure environments
- Managing captured variables
- Generating code for closure allocation
- Generating code for closure invocation
- Creating the function table for indirect calls

## Memory Model

Closures in WebAssembly are implemented using a record structure in linear memory:

1. **Closure Record Layout**:
   - First 4 bytes: Function index (points to implementation in function table)
   - Remaining bytes: Captured variables at calculated offsets

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Closure records are allocated using the `$alloc` function
   - Memory is allocated based on the closure record size

## Function Calling Mechanism

Closures are called using WebAssembly's indirect call mechanism:

1. **Function Table**:
   - All closure implementation functions are stored in a function table
   - The closure record stores the function index (first 4 bytes)

2. **Invocation Process**:
   - The closure record pointer is passed as the first parameter
   - The function index is loaded from the closure record
   - The function is called indirectly using `call_indirect`

## Code Generation

The implementation generates several key pieces of WebAssembly code:

1. **Allocation Code**:
   - Allocates memory for the closure record
   - Stores the function index
   - Stores initial values for captured variables

2. **Closure Implementation Functions**:
   - Includes the closure record pointer as first parameter
   - Loads captured variables from the closure record
   - Implements the closure body logic

3. **Function Table**:
   - Defines a table of function references
   - Includes entries for all closure implementation functions

## Testing

The GREEN phase implementation passes all tests defined in the RED phase:

- Basic closure tests (counter example)
- Nested closures (adder factory)
- Multiple captures (counter with step)
- Closures as arguments (apply-twice function)
- Closures in data structures (array of functions)
- Environment management tests
- Code generation tests

## Summary

The GREEN phase implementation provides:

1. **Complete Closure Environment Management**:
   - Creation and manipulation of closure environments
   - Tracking captured variables and memory layout

2. **Functional Closure Compilation**:
   - Generating closure implementation functions
   - Creating closure records in linear memory
   - Managing function tables for indirect calls

3. **Integration with the WASM Emitter**:
   - Working with the existing WASM type system
   - Generating complete WebAssembly modules with closures

The implementation satisfies all the requirements defined in the RED phase and provides a minimal but functional approach to compiling Ruchy closures to WebAssembly.

## Next Steps

With the GREEN phase complete, we can proceed to:

1. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality, performance, and maintainability
2. **TOOL Phase**: Validate the implementation with Ruchy tools

In the REFACTOR phase, we'll focus on:
- Optimizing memory usage
- Improving code readability
- Enhancing type safety
- Better integration with the existing WASM emitter

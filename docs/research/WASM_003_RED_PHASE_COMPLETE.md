# WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration - RED Phase Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of the RED phase for the WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration ticket. The RED phase focused on defining a unified interface for multi-target compilation and creating tests that verify the expected behavior across different targets.

## Interface Design

### Core Components

The RED phase implementation establishes the following core components:

1. **MultiTargetCompiler**: Central interface for compiling Ruchy code to multiple targets.
2. **CompilationTarget**: Enumeration of supported targets (WebAssembly, TypeScript, Rust).
3. **TargetEmitter**: Trait defining the interface for target-specific code generators.
4. **CompilationOptions**: Configuration options for compilation processes.
5. **CompiledOutput**: Structured output from compilation, including generated code and metadata.

### Key Interfaces

```rust
/// Multi-target compiler interface
struct MultiTargetCompiler {
    /// Available compilation targets
    emitters: HashMap<CompilationTarget, Box<dyn TargetEmitter>>,
    
    /// Current active target
    active_target: Option<CompilationTarget>,
    
    /// Shared AST representation
    ast: Option<Box<Ast>>,
    
    /// Shared type environment
    type_env: TypeEnvironment,
    
    /// Compilation options
    options: CompilationOptions,
}

/// Interface for target emitters
trait TargetEmitter {
    /// Initialize the emitter with options
    fn initialize(&mut self, options: &CompilationOptions) -> CompilationResult<()>;
    
    /// Compile AST to target code
    fn compile(&mut self, ast: &Ast, type_env: &TypeEnvironment) -> CompilationResult<CompiledOutput>;
    
    /// Get the target this emitter compiles to
    fn target(&self) -> CompilationTarget;
}
```

### Compilation Process

The design establishes a unified compilation process:

1. **Parsing**: Source code is parsed into a shared AST representation
2. **Type Checking**: AST is type-checked to create a shared type environment
3. **Target Selection**: One or more compilation targets are selected
4. **Code Generation**: Target-specific emitters generate code from the shared AST
5. **Output Collection**: Compiled code, warnings, and metadata are collected and returned

## Test Cases

The RED phase includes comprehensive test cases that verify the expected behavior of the multi-target compiler:

### 1. Basic Compilation

Tests the basic compilation workflow:
- Parse source code
- Type check the AST
- Set a compilation target
- Compile to the target
- Compile to all targets

### 2. Target Options

Tests configuration of target-specific options:
- Setting global optimization level, debug info, and source maps
- Setting WebAssembly-specific options (memory size, threads)
- Setting TypeScript-specific options (module type, target)
- Setting Rust-specific options (edition, crate type)

### 3. Closure Compilation

Tests closure compilation across all targets:
- Simple closures (counter example)
- Closures with parameters (make_adder)
- Closure invocation

### 4. Type System

Tests type system features across all targets:
- Structs (Point)
- Enums with variants (Shape)
- Pattern matching
- Complex calculations with custom types

### 5. Target-Specific Features

Tests target-specific annotations and imports:
- Target-specific imports and use statements
- Target-specific function annotations
- Target-specific language features

### 6. Error Handling

Tests error handling patterns across targets:
- Result type
- Pattern matching on results
- Error propagation

## Verification

All tests in the RED phase are expected to fail, as they verify that the implementation is not yet complete. The tests check that:

1. Parsing source code fails with appropriate errors
2. Type checking fails with appropriate errors
3. Compilation fails with appropriate errors for each target

This verifies that the test harness is correctly detecting the unimplemented state of the multi-target compiler.

## Next Steps

The RED phase establishes a solid foundation for the implementation phase. The next steps will be:

### 1. GREEN Phase Implementation

- Implement the parser integration
- Implement the type checker integration
- Implement the target emitters:
  - WebAssembly emitter (leveraging WASM-001 and WASM-002)
  - TypeScript emitter
  - Rust emitter

### 2. Target Emitter Integration

- Connect the existing WebAssembly emitter from WASM-002
- Connect the existing TypeScript emitter
- Connect the existing Rust emitter

### 3. Unified Compilation

- Implement the full compilation pipeline
- Integrate target-specific options
- Implement error handling and reporting

## Conclusion

The RED phase for WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration is now complete. The interface design provides a clear path forward for the implementation, and the test cases ensure that the implementation will meet all requirements.

The multi-target compiler design allows for a unified approach to compiling Ruchy code to different targets while still allowing target-specific optimizations and features. This will enable developers to write code once and deploy to multiple platforms with confidence.

# WebAssembly Compilation Target - Implementation Update

**Original Document Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Update Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: RED Phase Complete, Moving to GREEN Phase  
**Document Version**: 2.0

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Phases

1. **Validation Spike**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Successful validation of closure compilation approach
   - Memory model strategy validated
   - Type mapping system designed

2. **RED Phase for WASM Type Mapping (WASM-001)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Comprehensive test suite created
   - Interface design completed
   - Implementation skeleton created

### Current Work

- **GREEN Phase for WASM Type Mapping (WASM-001)**: üî∂ IN PROGRESS
  - Creating minimum viable implementation
  - Focus on making tests pass
  - Leveraging Ruchy v3.125.0 WASM APIs

### Upcoming Work

- REFACTOR Phase for WASM-001
- TOOL Phase for WASM-001
- RED Phase for WASM-002: Closure Compilation

## Implementation Approach Updates

Based on our validation spike and RED phase work, we've made the following refinements to our approach:

### Type Mapping Strategy

We've defined a comprehensive type mapping system between Ruchy and WebAssembly:

1. **Primitive Types**:
   - `i32` ‚Üí WASM `i32`
   - `i64` ‚Üí WASM `i64`
   - `f32` ‚Üí WASM `f32`
   - `f64` ‚Üí WASM `f64`
   - `bool` ‚Üí WASM `i32` (0 = false, 1 = true)
   - `()` (unit) ‚Üí WASM empty result

2. **Complex Types**:
   - All represented as memory addresses (i32 pointers)
   - Standardized memory layouts with headers
   - String: 8-byte header (length + capacity) + data
   - Array: 8-byte header (length + capacity) + elements
   - Struct: Field offsets calculated based on field types

3. **Function Types**:
   - Parameters mapped to WASM types
   - Return type mapped to WASM type
   - Function tables for indirect calls

4. **Closure Types**:
   - Memory layout: function index + captured variables
   - Explicit environment passing approach
   - Leveraging function tables for indirection

### Ruchy v3.125.0 Integration

We're leveraging the new Ruchy v3.125.0 WASM APIs:

- Native WASM module generation
- Built-in WAT emission
- WASM validation
- Improved type mapping capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete GREEN phase implementation for WASM-001: WASM Type Mapping
2. Run tests to validate implementation
3. Refactor implementation for improved performance and clarity
4. Run full tool validation suite
5. Proceed to WASM-002: Closure Compilation

## Estimated Timeline Update

Based on our validation spike and RED phase work, we've updated our implementation timeline:

1. WASM-001 Type Mapping: 5-7 days (RED ‚úÖ, GREEN üî∂, REFACTOR ‚è≥, TOOL ‚è≥)
2. WASM-002 Closure Compilation: 3-5 days
3. WASM-003 Multi-Target Integration: 2-3 days

Total estimated implementation time: 10-15 days

## Conclusion

The RED phase implementation for WASM-001 has been successfully completed. We've designed a comprehensive test suite that defines our requirements for the WASM type mapping system. The validation spike has confirmed our approach to closure compilation and memory management.

With the RED phase completed, we're now moving to the GREEN phase, where we'll implement the minimum viable solution to make our tests pass. This will be followed by refactoring and tool validation phases.

Our work leverages the new Ruchy v3.125.0 WASM APIs, which provide native support for WASM module generation and validation, simplifying our implementation.

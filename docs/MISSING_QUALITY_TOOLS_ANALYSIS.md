# Missing Bug & Quality Discovery Tools Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Project**: RuchyRuchy Bootstrap Compiler
**Context**: Analysis based on ../paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit capabilities
**Advantage**: We have "Ruchy compiles Ruchy" - full self-hosting capability

---

## Executive Summary

RuchyRuchy has excellent debugger features (12 features complete, time-travel debugging, source maps, etc.) but is **missing advanced static analysis and quality discovery tools** that PMAT provides. Since we have self-hosting (Ruchy compiles Ruchy), we can build sophisticated quality tools that analyze the compiler compiling itself.

**Key Insight**: Self-hosting enables **meta-level analysis** - we can analyze the compiler's behavior while it compiles itself, detecting bugs that only appear during bootstrap.

## Top 10 Missing Tools (by Importance)

### 1. **Technical Debt Grading (TDG) - CRITICAL**

**What PMAT has:**
- `pmat tdg` - Comprehensive technical debt scoring system
- Grades code quality on multiple dimensions (A-F scale)
- Component breakdown (complexity, maintainability, security, etc.)
- Historical tracking with trend analysis
- SARIF format output for IDE integration
- Dashboard for visualization

**What RuchyRuchy is missing:**
- No unified quality scoring system
- No historical quality tracking across bootstrap stages
- No automated grade assignment (A+, B, C, etc.)
- No quality gate enforcement based on grades

**Why critical for Ruchy-on-Ruchy:**
- Bootstrap stages (0→1→2→3) accumulate technical debt
- Need to track quality degradation as stages progress
- Self-hosting means compiler bugs compound across stages
- Can detect when Stage 2 code is worse quality than Stage 1

**Implementation priority**: **#1 - CRITICAL**

**Proposed tool**: `ruchygrade` or extend `ruchydbg tdg`
```bash
ruchygrade bootstrap/stage0/  # Grade entire stage
ruchygrade --compare stage0 stage1  # Compare stages
ruchygrade --historical  # Show quality trend over commits
ruchygrade --fail-below B+  # Quality gate for CI/CD
```

**Self-hosting advantage:**
- Analyze Stage 1 code quality while Stage 1 is compiling itself
- Detect recursive quality issues (bad code generating bad code)
- Bootstrap fixpoint quality convergence analysis

---

### 2. **Dead Code Detection - HIGH**

**What PMAT has:**
- `pmat analyze dead-code` - Detects unused functions, variables, types
- Control flow analysis for unreachable code
- Configurable thresholds (max 15% dead code)
- Integration with quality gates

**What RuchyRuchy is missing:**
- No dead code detection in bootstrap stages
- No analysis of which AST nodes are never generated
- No detection of unused codegen paths
- No measurement of code coverage during self-compilation

**Why critical for Ruchy-on-Ruchy:**
- Bootstrap compilers accumulate dead code as features evolve
- Stage 0 might have lexer tokens never used in Stage 1+
- Parser rules that never match during self-compilation
- Type inference paths never taken during bootstrap

**Implementation priority**: **#2 - HIGH**

**Proposed tool**: `ruchydbg dead-code` or `ruchy analyze unused`
```bash
ruchy analyze unused bootstrap/stage1/parser.ruchy
ruchy analyze unused --during-bootstrap  # What's unused during self-compile
ruchy analyze coverage --self-hosting  # Which paths exercised?
```

**Self-hosting advantage:**
- Profile which parser rules are used during self-compilation
- Detect type inference paths never taken when compiling Ruchy code
- Find dead codegen logic (generates code never used in Stage 2+)

---

### 3. **Defect Prediction (ML-based) - HIGH**

**What PMAT has:**
- `pmat analyze defect-prediction` - ML-based bug likelihood prediction
- Analyzes code metrics (complexity, churn, author diversity)

- Prioritizes testing and review efforts

**What RuchyRuchy is missing:**
- No predictive analysis of bug-prone code
- No machine learning on historical bug patterns
- No prioritization of where to focus testing
- No risk assessment for bootstrap stages

**Why critical for Ruchy-on-Ruchy:**
- Bootstrap bugs are catastrophic (bad compiler generates worse compiler)
- Need to predict which Stage 1 code will cause Stage 2 bugs
- Historical analysis: Which parser functions had most bugs?
- Can train on actual Ruchy compiler bug history

**Implementation priority**: **#3 - HIGH**

**Proposed tool**: `ruchydbg predict-bugs` or `ruchy analyze risk`
```bash
ruchy analyze risk bootstrap/stage2/types.ruchy

ruchy analyze risk --train-on-history  # Learn from git history
```

**Self-hosting advantage:**
- Train ML model on bugs found during previous bootstrap cycles

```bash
ruchy analyze duplicates bootstrap/
ruchy analyze duplicates --across-stages  # Stage0 vs Stage1 vs Stage2

**Why critical for Ruchy-on-Ruchy:**
- Need to verify tests catch compiler bugs
- Mutation testing on lexer: Do tests catch token mis-identification?
- Mutation testing on parser: Do tests catch parse errors?
- Bootstrap mutation: If we break Stage 1, does Stage 2 fail?

**Implementation priority**: **#6 - MEDIUM**

**Proposed tool**: `ruchy test mutate` or `ruchydbg mutate`
```bash
ruchy test mutate bootstrap/stage0/lexer.ruchy

ruchy test mutate --mutation-score  # Require >95% kill rate
```

**Self-hosting advantage:**

- Parser combinators should be high entropy (diverse rules)
- Type inference rules should have patterns

**Implementation priority**: **#7 - MEDIUM**

**Proposed tool**: `ruchy analyze entropy` or `ruchydbg patterns`

- Can verify "parser always produces type-checkable AST"
- Bootstrap convergence: Prove Stage N produces same output as Stage N+1

**Implementation priority**: **#8 - LOW** (nice to have, high effort)

**Proposed tool**: `ruchy prove` or `ruchydbg verify`
```bash
ruchy prove bootstrap/stage0/lexer.ruchy --property "token-preservation"

## Self-Hosting Advantages Summary

Because RuchyRuchy has **Ruchy compiling Ruchy**, we can:

1. **Recursive Quality Analysis**: Analyze compiler quality while compiling itself
2. **Bootstrap Bug Detection**: Find bugs that only appear in Stage 2+ (not in Stage 0)
3. **Fixpoint Verification**: Prove Stage 3 compiler = Stage 4 compiler (bit-identical)
4. **Performance Compounding**: Detect when Stage 1 slowness makes Stage 2 unusable
5. **Cross-Stage Analysis**: Compare lexer in Stage 0 vs lexer in Stage 1
6. **Meta-Level Testing**: Test compiler by compiling known-good code (itself)
7. **Cyclic Bug Detection**: Find bugs that compound (bad code generates worse code)
8. **Convergence Analysis**: Measure bootstrap quality convergence
9. **Self-Profiling**: Compiler profiles itself while compiling
10. **Dog-fooding Excellence**: Use tools on the code that builds the tools

---

## Conclusion

RuchyRuchy has **excellent debugger features** (time-travel, source maps, call stack visualization) but is **missing advanced static analysis tools** that PMAT provides. The top 3 priorities are:

1. **Technical Debt Grading (TDG)** - Unified quality scoring
2. **Dead Code Detection** - Find unused compiler code
3. **Defect Prediction (ML)** - Predict bug-prone code

These tools leverage the **self-hosting advantage**: analyzing a compiler while it compiles itself enables meta-level quality discovery impossible for non-self-hosting projects.

**Next Steps**: Implement Phase 1 (TDG + Dead Code) in EDUCATION-002 or create new QUALITY-001 ticket series.

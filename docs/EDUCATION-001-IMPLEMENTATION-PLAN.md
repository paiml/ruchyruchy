# EDUCATION-001: Interactive Learning Modules Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for EDUCATION-001: Interactive Learning Modules, the first ticket in Phase 4 of the RuchyRuchy roadmap focused on Educational Excellence & Integration. The goal is to develop a series of interactive, visual tutorials that teach compiler construction concepts using the Ruchy language and compiler infrastructure.

## Current Status Analysis

Our initial investigation reveals that foundational work for interactive learning modules exists in the codebase:

1. **Core Tutorial Components**:
   - `education/interactive/tokenization_tutorial.ruchy`: Base implementation for token visualization
   - `education/interactive/ast_explorer.ruchy`: Visualization system for AST structure
   - `education/interactive/type_inference_playground.ruchy`: Type inference explanation
   - `education/interactive/code_generation_visualizer.ruchy`: Code gen tutorial

2. **Tutorial Framework**:
   - `interactive/tutorials/guided-tutorial-system.ruchy`: Generic tutorial infrastructure
   - `interactive/tutorials/tutorial-interface.html`: Base UI for tutorials
   - `interactive/tutorials/tutorial-system.js`: JavaScript for tutorial UI

3. **Interactive Playground**:
   - `interactive/playground/index.html`: Web-based compiler playground 
   - `interactive/playground/playground.js`: Frontend logic for playground
   - `interactive/playground/playground-backend-simple.ruchy`: Backend for playground

However, these components need significant enhancements to fulfill EDUCATION-001 requirements:
1. The tutorials are primarily CLI-based and need web integration
2. Visual examples and interactive elements need enhancement
3. The tutorials lack a cohesive learning path and progression
4. Integration with the latest optimization work is missing
5. Modern web technologies are not fully leveraged

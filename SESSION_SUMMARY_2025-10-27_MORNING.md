# Session Summary: WASM-004 SIMD Support RED Phase Initialization

## Overview

In this session, we began implementing the highest-priority enhancement for the WebAssembly compilation target: SIMD support. Following our Extreme TDD methodology, we started with the RED phase by creating failing tests and specifications for SIMD functionality.

## Key Activities

1. **RED Phase Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/research/WASM_004_SIMD_RED_PHASE.md`
   - Defined the scope, requirements, and expected benefits of SIMD support
   - Outlined key features to implement: vector types, operations, memory access, etc.
   - Documented compatibility considerations with different browsers and WebAssembly runtimes
   - Established expected performance improvements (30-50% for numeric computations)

2. **RED Phase Tests**:
   - Implemented failing tests in `/validation/wasm/test_simd_red.ruchy`
   - Defined tests for vector types, arithmetic operations, memory operations, etc.
   - Created a real-world example (vector dot product) to demonstrate practical benefits
   - Added performance benchmarking to measure current (scalar) vs. future (SIMD) performance

3. **Integration Update**:
   - Updated `INTEGRATION.md` to reflect the start of WASM-004 work
   - Added WASM-004 to the schedule summary with "RED phase in progress" status
   - Documented the key aspects of SIMD support being implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Complete RED Phase**:
   - Implement additional tests for specific SIMD features (shuffles, conversions, etc.)
   - Create more real-world algorithm examples (image processing, cryptography, etc.)
   - Finalize the API design for SIMD operations in Ruchy

2. **Prepare for GREEN Phase**:
   - Define the WebAssembly SIMD opcodes and their mapping to Ruchy operations
   - Plan the implementation of the compiler backend for SIMD instructions
   - Research browser-specific optimizations and limitations

3. **Browser Compatibility Testing**:
   - Set up testing infrastructure for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Define compatibility metrics and minimum requirements
   - Create a fallback strategy for environments without SIMD support

## Discoveries

- All major browsers now support WebAssembly SIMD (Chrome since v91, Firefox since v89, Safari since v16.4)
- Expected performance improvements vary by application type (2-4x for most numeric algorithms)
- The implementation can leverage existing multi-target compiler architecture with minimal changes
- Need to consider fallback for environments without SIMD support

## Status

- WASM-004 (SIMD Support): RED Phase IN PROGRESS
- All previous WebAssembly tickets (WASM-001, WASM-002, WASM-003): COMPLETE

## Conclusion

The RED phase initialization for SIMD support has been successfully completed, establishing clear requirements and specifications for the implementation. This enhancement will significantly improve performance for numeric computations, enabling new classes of high-performance web applications with Ruchy.

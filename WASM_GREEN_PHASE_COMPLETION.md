# WASM-001: GREEN Phase Implementation Completion Report

## Summary

We have successfully completed the GREEN phase implementation for WASM-001: WebAssembly Type Mapping. This is a significant milestone in our WebAssembly compilation target implementation, providing the core functionality for mapping Ruchy types to WebAssembly.

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Type Mapping System**
   - Comprehensive mapping of Ruchy types to WASM types
   - Memory layout calculation for complex types
   - Support for strings, arrays, structs, functions, and closures

2. **WASM Emitter**
   - Module generation with proper sections
   - Function registration and emission
   - WebAssembly Text Format (WAT) generation

3. **Memory Model**
   - Linear memory representation for complex types
   - Field offset calculation for structs
   - Header-based approach for collections

4. **Utility Functions**
   - Type mapping utilities
   - Literal conversion to WASM instructions

## Syntax Note

The implementation uses Rust syntax (`fn` instead of `fun`) to match the conventions used in other parts of the project. This was validated by examining existing files in the project, such as `bootstrap/stage3/rust_emission.ruchy`.

## Testing

We've created a test that confirms our implementation is working correctly. The test demonstrates that:

1. The WASM emitter has been implemented
2. The type mapping system is in place
3. Memory layouts are correctly calculated
4. The module generation works as expected

## Mock WASM API

Since the actual WASM API may not be fully available in the current Ruchy version, we've created a mock API that includes all the necessary components for development and testing. This approach allows us to develop the implementation without direct dependencies on the actual WASM API.

## Next Steps

With the GREEN phase completed, we'll proceed to:

1. **REFACTOR phase**: Improve code quality, performance, and clarity
2. **TOOL phase**: Run validation tools to verify implementation quality
3. **WASM-002**: Implement Closure Compilation (next feature in roadmap)

## Conclusion

The completion of the GREEN phase for WASM-001 brings us one step closer to having a fully functional WebAssembly compilation target for Ruchy. We've successfully implemented the core type mapping functionality, providing a solid foundation for the rest of the WASM implementation.

The approach we've taken aligns with our Extreme TDD methodology, with a focus on first defining the expected behavior through tests (RED phase) and then implementing the minimum viable functionality to make those tests pass (GREEN phase).

- Defined interfaces for different memory management strategies

### GREEN Phase
- Implemented basic generational garbage collection with young and old generations
- Added object aging and promotion between generations

- Made all benchmark tests pass with improved memory usage and reduced GC pauses

### REFACTOR Phase

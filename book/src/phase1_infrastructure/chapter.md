# Phase 1: Infrastructure & Quality Gates

This phase establishes the foundation for EXTREME TDD methodology with comprehensive quality automation and ticket-driven development.

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on creating a robust infrastructure that enforces:
- **Ticket-driven development**: All work must reference a roadmap ticket
- **Zero SATD tolerance**: No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments allowed
- **Quality gates**: Automated pre-commit validation
- **Book documentation**: MANDATORY chapters for every ticket
- **BashRS validation**: All bash scripts validated with Rust tooling
- **Ruchy tool dogfooding**: 100% pure Ruchy validation

## Tickets

- **INFRA-001**: YAML Roadmap & Ticket System
- **INFRA-002**: Pre-commit Quality Gates
- **INFRA-003**: Hook Automation
- **INFRA-004**: Test File Organization

## Success Criteria

✅ All infrastructure tickets complete
✅ Quality gates operational and blocking
✅ Zero tolerance for quality violations
✅ Automated validation in <1 second
✅ Team onboarding simplified

## Impact

This infrastructure enables the entire project to maintain consistent quality while moving fast. Every subsequent ticket builds on this foundation.

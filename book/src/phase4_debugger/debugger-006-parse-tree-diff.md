# DEBUGGER-006: Parse Tree Diff

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Ticket**: DEBUGGER-006
**Phase**: 100% EXTREME TDD (8/8 phases complete)
**Started**: October 22, 2025
**Completed**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

DEBUGGER-006 implements **Parse Tree Diff** - structural comparison of abstract syntax trees for regression testing and compiler version comparison. This is the **third and final feature of Phase 2** (Parser Debugging) and completes the parser debugging suite entirely.

**Why This Matters:**
- Regression detection catches parser changes that break compatibility
- Structural diff enables before/after comparison during refactoring
- Automated testing validates compiler modifications don't alter semantics
- Visual diff in VS Code helps understand parser evolution

## 🏆 PHASE 2 COMPLETE! 🏆

With DEBUGGER-006, **Phase 2 (Parser Debugging) is 100% complete**:
- ✅ DEBUGGER-004: Parse Stack Inspection
- ✅ DEBUGGER-005: AST Visualization  
- ✅ DEBUGGER-006: Parse Tree Diff

**Issue #1 FULLY RESOLVED** - Enhanced parser debugging tools operational!

## All 8 EXTREME TDD Phases Summary

### Phase 1: RED - 4/10 passing (demonstrates need)
### Phase 2: GREEN - 247 LOC, 10/10 passing
### Phase 3: REFACTOR - GREEN baseline (clean structure)
### Phase 4: TOOL - A+ grade (0 errors)
### Phase 5: MUTATION - 100% score (6/6 mutations killed)
### Phase 6: PROPERTY - 750 iterations (100% pass)
### Phase 7: FUZZ - 120K iterations (0 crashes)
### Phase 8: PORTFOLIO - 100 runs (variance 0, 100% determinism)

**Total: 120,860+ test executions**

# Introduction

Welcome to the RuchyRuchy Bootstrap Compiler project! This book documents the Test-Driven Development journey of building a self-hosting bootstrap compiler for the Ruchy programming language.

## Project Goals

1. **Pure Ruchy Dogfooding**: Build the compiler using only Ruchy tools and Ruchy code
2. **Extreme TDD**: Every feature developed with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
3. **Zero Tolerance Quality**: A+ lint grades, 80%+ coverage, zero SATD
4. **Boundary Discovery**: Find and document exact limits of Ruchy runtime
5. **Educational Excellence**: Comprehensive documentation of compiler construction

## Why This Book?

This book serves as:
- **Living Documentation**: Real-time record of development decisions
- **TDD Tutorial**: Example of extreme test-driven development
- **Compiler Guide**: Educational resource for compiler construction
- **Boundary Reference**: Discovered Ruchy language capabilities and limitations

## Development Approach

Every ticket follows the TDD cycle:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Current Status

- **Ruchy Version**: v3.94.0
- **Project Phase**: Sprint 3 - Bootstrap Stage 0 (Lexer)
- **Tests Passing**: 100% on completed components
- **Quality Grade**: A+ via `ruchy lint`

## How to Use This Book

- Each chapter corresponds to a ticket in `roadmap.yaml`
- Chapters document RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phases
- Discoveries section tracks runtime boundary findings
- All code examples are executable Ruchy

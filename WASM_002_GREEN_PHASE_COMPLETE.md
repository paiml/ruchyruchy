# WASM-002: Closure Compilation - GREEN Phase Complete

## Summary
The GREEN phase implementation for WASM-002: Closure Compilation is now complete. All tests from the RED phase are now passing with the minimal implementation required.

## Implementation Components
1. **ClosureEnvironment**: Manages captured variables and memory layout
2. **ClosureImplementation**: Represents compiled closure functions
3. **ClosureCompiler**: Handles compilation of closures to WebAssembly
4. **WasmEmitter integration**: Works with existing WASM infrastructure

## Key Features
- Closure record structure in linear memory
- Function table for indirect function calls
- Captured variable management
- Memory allocation for closure records
- Code generation for closure invocation

## Test Results
✅ Basic closure tests (counter example)
✅ Nested closures (adder factory)
✅ Multiple captures (counter with step)
✅ Closures as arguments (apply-twice function)
✅ Closures in data structures (array of functions)
✅ Closure environment management
✅ Closure code generation

## Technical Details
- **Memory Model**: Closure records in linear memory with function index + captured variables
- **Calling Convention**: Closure record pointer as first parameter to implementation functions
- **Indirect Calls**: Using WebAssembly function tables and call_indirect

## Next Steps
1. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality and performance
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Enhance type safety
   - Improve code organization

2. **TOOL Phase**: Validate with Ruchy tools
   - Verify with formal analysis
   - Validate with property testing
   - Measure performance metrics

The implementation satisfies all requirements specified in the RED phase and provides a working foundation for the REFACTOR and TOOL phases.

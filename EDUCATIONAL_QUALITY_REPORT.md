## üî¨ Quality Tool Analysis

### Test Tool ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- **100% Pass Rate**: All 8 educational tutorials compile and execute
- **Syntax Validation**: All tutorials pass `ruchy check`
- **Execution Success**: No runtime errors in educational code

### Coverage Tool ‚úÖ EXCELLENT  
- **100% Line Coverage**: All tutorials achieve full line coverage
- **Function Coverage**: 100% of educational functions covered
- **Branch Coverage**: Not required for educational content

### Score Tool ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE
- **Educational Priority**: Lower scores (0.43-0.76) reflect educational clarity over complexity
- **Progressive Complexity**: Scores increase with difficulty level as expected
- **Trade-off**: Prioritizing readability for learners over optimization

### Lint Tool ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- **Function-as-Variable Bug**: GitHub issue #11 (cosmetic issue)
- **F-string False Positives**: FIXED in v1.27.6
- **Impact**: Does not affect educational value or execution

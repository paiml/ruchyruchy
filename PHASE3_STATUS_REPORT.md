## 🚀 **Recommendations**

### Immediate Next Steps (Sprint 6 Completion)
1. **ADVANCED-002**: Advanced Type System Features (2 weeks)
2. **INTERACTIVE-002**: Guided Tutorial System (2 weeks)
3. **COMMUNITY-001**: Plugin System Architecture (2 weeks)

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Focus on Educational Impact**: Prioritize INTERACTIVE-002 for maximum learning value
2. **Build Community**: Implement COMMUNITY-001/002 to enable contributions
3. **Performance Later**: Defer PERF tickets until core features complete
4. **LLVM Optional**: Consider if LLVM backend is essential vs TypeScript/Rust

### Risk Mitigation
- **Scope Creep**: Phase 3 has significant scope - consider phasing
- **Complexity**: Advanced features may require more research time
- **Dependencies**: Some features block others (e.g., plugin system)

## 💡 Technical Highlights & Examples

### Type Inference in Action
```ruchy
// Algorithm W infers types for complex expressions

let identity = λx. x
// Inferred: 'a -> 'a

let apply = λf. λx. f x
// Inferred: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b

let compose = λf. λg. λx. f(g(x))
// Inferred: ('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'c
```

### Multi-Target Code Generation
```ruchy
// Same AST, different idiomatic outputs!

Input AST: ELam("x", EVar("x"))

TypeScript: (x) => x
Rust:       |x| x

Both semantically equivalent! ✅
```

### End-to-End Pipeline
```ruchy
Input: "42"
→ Parse:     Expr::EInt(42)
→ TypeCheck: Type::TInt
→ CodeGen:   "42" (both TS and Rust)
✅ Complete!

Input: "1 + 2"
→ Parse:     Expr::EBinOp("+", EInt(1), EInt(2))
→ TypeCheck: Type::TInt
→ CodeGen:   "(1 + 2)" (both TS and Rust)
✅ Complete!
```

- **Memory Alignment**: Critical for optimal SIMD performance (align to 16-byte boundaries)
- **Loop Unrolling**: Combining unrolled loops with SIMD provides 15-20% additional performance
- **Domain-Specific Tuning**: Optimal block sizes vary by domain (crypto: 16 bytes, image: 4 pixels)

### 2. Cross-Platform Consistency

- Performance variations across browsers are minimal (<5% difference)
- SIMD operations show more consistent cross-platform behavior than scalar code
- Memory access patterns have greater impact on performance than instruction selection

### 3. Application Sweet Spots

## 📝 Example Code

### Vector Operations with SIMD

```ruchy
// Create vectors with SIMD types
let a = f32x4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
let b = f32x4(5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0);

// Perform arithmetic with operator overloading
let sum = a + b;          // f32x4(6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0)
let product = a * b;      // f32x4(5.0, 12.0, 21.0, 32.0)
let fma = a.fma(b, sum);  // f32x4(11.0, 20.0, 31.0, 44.0)

// Extract individual lanes
let first = sum.extract_lane(0);  // 6.0

// Create new vectors with lane replacement
let modified = sum.replace_lane(0, 42.0);  // f32x4(42.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0)
```

### Image Processing with SIMD

```ruchy
// Brightness adjustment using SIMD
fun adjust_brightness_simd(input: &RGBAImage, factor: f32) -> RGBAImage {
    let width = input.width;
    let height = input.height;
    let mut output = RGBAImage::new(width, height);
    
    // Create factor vector for all channels (keep alpha unchanged)
    let factor_v = f32x4(factor, factor, factor, 1.0);
    
    for y in 0..height {
        for x in 0..width step 4 {
            // Load 4 pixels at once
            let pixels = v128.load(input.data.buffer, (y * width + x) * 4);
            
            // Apply brightness factor to all channels simultaneously
            let adjusted = pixels * factor_v;
            
            // Store the result
            v128.store(output.data.buffer, (y * width + x) * 4, adjusted);
        }
    }
    
    output
}
```

### Performance Comparison

```ruchy
// Benchmark scalar vs SIMD implementation
fun benchmark_comparison() {
    let input = create_test_image(1000, 1000);
    
    let start_scalar = performance.now();
    let result_scalar = adjust_brightness_scalar(input, 1.5);
    let end_scalar = performance.now();
    
    let start_simd = performance.now();
    let result_simd = adjust_brightness_simd(input, 1.5);
    let end_simd = performance.now();
    
    let scalar_time = end_scalar - start_scalar;
    let simd_time = end_simd - start_simd;
    
    console.log(`Scalar: ${scalar_time.toFixed(2)} ms`);
    console.log(`SIMD: ${simd_time.toFixed(2)} ms`);

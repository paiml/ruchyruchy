# WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration - GREEN Phase Complete

## Summary
The GREEN phase for WASM-003: Multi-Target Integration is now complete. The implementation successfully compiles Ruchy code to WebAssembly, TypeScript, and Rust using a unified interface. All tests from the RED phase now pass, providing a functional multi-target compiler.

## Implementation Components

### Core Components
- **RuchyParser**: Converts source code into a shared AST representation
- **RuchyTypeChecker**: Type checks the AST and builds a type environment
- **Target Emitters**: Implementations for WebAssembly, TypeScript, and Rust
- **MultiTargetCompiler**: Orchestrates the full compilation pipeline

### Key Interfaces
```rust
struct MultiTargetCompilerImpl {
    emitters: HashMap<CompilationTarget, Box<dyn TargetEmitter>>,
    active_target: Option<CompilationTarget>,
    ast: Option<Box<Ast>>,
    type_env: TypeEnvironment,
    options: CompilationOptions,
}

trait TargetEmitter {
    fn initialize(&mut self, options: &CompilationOptions) -> CompilationResult<()>;
    fn compile(&mut self, ast: &Ast, type_env: &TypeEnvironment) -> CompilationResult<CompiledOutput>;
    fn target(&self) -> CompilationTarget;
}
```

## Supported Features

All features are supported across all targets:

1. **Basic Compilation**: Simple programs and function definitions
2. **Closures**: Variable capture, nested closures, and closure invocation
3. **Type System**: Structs, enums, and pattern matching
4. **Target-Specific Features**: Target-specific annotations and imports
5. **Error Handling**: Result type and pattern matching on errors
6. **Compilation Options**: Global and target-specific configuration

## Target Implementations

### WebAssembly
- Uses the emitter from WASM-002 for closure compilation
- Generates WebAssembly Text Format (WAT) with memory management
- Supports function tables for closures

### TypeScript
- Generates TypeScript code with native JavaScript closures
- Creates type definitions for Ruchy types
- Includes source maps for debugging

### Rust
- Generates Rust code with appropriate type definitions
- Includes Cargo.toml with configuration options
- Uses native Rust features like Result and move closures

## Test Results

All tests from the RED phase now pass:

- ✅ **Basic Compilation**: Parses and compiles simple programs
- ✅ **Target Options**: Configures compilation options correctly
- ✅ **Closure Compilation**: Handles closures across all targets
- ✅ **Type System**: Compiles structs and enums correctly
- ✅ **Target-Specific Features**: Handles target-specific code
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Supports error handling patterns
- ✅ **Full Pipeline**: Runs the complete compilation process

## Output Structure

The implementation generates a comprehensive output structure:

```rust
struct CompiledOutput {
    target: CompilationTarget,
    content: String,
    additional_files: HashMap<String, String>,
    warnings: Vec<String>,
    metadata: CompilationMetadata,
}
```

This includes the main code, additional files (e.g., type definitions), warnings, and compilation metadata for each target.

## Next Steps

1. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality and performance
   - Optimize the compilation process
   - Enhance error handling and reporting
   - Improve code organization

2. **TOOL Phase**: Validate with Ruchy tools
   - Verify with property testing
   - Measure performance
   - Assess code quality

The GREEN phase implementation provides a solid foundation for the multi-target compiler, enabling Ruchy code to be compiled to multiple targets with a unified interface.
